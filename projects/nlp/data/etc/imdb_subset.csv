0_0,"I admit, the great majority of films released before say 1933 are just not for me. Of the dozen or so ""major"" silents I have viewed, one I loved (The Crowd), and two were very good (The Last Command and City Lights, that latter Chaplin circa 1931).<br /><br />So I was apprehensive about this one, and humor is often difficult to appreciate (uh, enjoy) decades later. I did like the lead actors, but thought little of the film.<br /><br />One intriguing sequence. Early on, the guys are supposed to get ""de-loused"" and for about three minutes, fully dressed, do some schtick. In the background, perhaps three dozen men pass by, all naked, white and black (WWI ?), and for most, their butts, part or full backside, are shown. Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of Howard Hughes?"

First of all the very theme is eternal life and how to get it.Sounds promising, doesn't it?Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn in conflict in which they forget the cause,and the conflict becomes it's own purpose.Until... Zemeckis gives us a film with,some might say,predictable plot.But isn't this a satire of the whole scheme? It's filled with smart little jokes and details.Every scene is very precisely built and planed.There was interesting use of longer shots with rich(er) mise-en-scene, and tension built by great editing. In her role Meryl Streep gave us so many wonderful,depicting and amusing little things that she does.Detailes,detailes!Goldie was also very funny,and Bruce was certainly unusual(but in a good way). This film could be used as great lesson in film directing.As a satire it touches a great number of Hollywood film clichés.But isn't learning how to film those clichés basis for making something unique? Anyway,great thanx to the creators of this film!"
10090_0,"This was a ""real"" vampire movie. I liked it when I first saw it in '79 and I like it more now. Lynch captures a vampire that is cultured, charismatic, vulnerable, and still human. He collects rare art! As the film progresses we learn this vampire is also evil, materialistic, vengeful, exploitative, selfish, and classically Evil with a capital ""E"". This movie thoughtfully updated elements of Stoker's conceptualization of the vampire without losing those classical elements that makes it an interesting tale. Acting is excellent and casting great. I had hoped this would be made into a series... but, oh well. A few producers of modern vampire movies could learn something by watching this. <br /><br />My video copy is coming apart - so when is this thing coming on on DVD already?"
10135_0,"In addition to being a great story about a little-depicted part of North America's history, Black Robe portrays with stark effect the wide gap in the way that white Europeans thought and acted compared to the way that native Americans thought and acted in the 17th Century."
10180_0,"Like other reviewers, I was going to avoid this movie within the first few minutes because of its austere quality. Black and white, gritty, bare-boned filming and direction looking at awkward people in a strangely quiet way. <br /><br />A scraping by man that is one step away from Adam in implements scratching out a living suddenly comes by an ailing pregnant woman who he befriends and keeps alive by stretching the tight shoestring he's already living on, taut to its limit.<br /><br />But then, as the story unfolds, you realize it HAD to be shot in black and white; it had to have that raw, gritty quality. That's the nature of the story. That's the power of it.<br /><br />I agree, too, with other reviewers that if (as some of us have been theorizing) the woman and her child were written to be Black, that would bring several new levels of poignancy to every aspect of the film. And you can read that in as you watch and appreciate those nuances for yourself though they're not spelled out in the film. <br /><br />I also had the strange thought while watching of how great it would have been to have Johnny and June Carter Cash playing the leads, since this film was made in their heyday. But that's just me.<br /><br />Yet even as it is, this is a rare piece of coal that under the pressure of tough times shows itself to be a diamond. Not to be missed."

10315_0,"Thumb Tripping is a little-known hippie road movie made in 1972. It's little-known for a reason. The reason is that it is somewhat poor.... and those who saw it (of which there were few) did not build for it a word-of-mouth reputation of any note. There are a few cast members in it who went on to bigger and better things, notably Meg Foster and Bruce Dern; also the director Quentin Masters would later score a sexploitation hit with the Joan Collins movie The Stud. However, in this film there is very little of interest other than a freewheeling narrative that offers occasional insights into the permissive and casual attitudes of the youth of the late '60s/early '70s. In most departments, Thumb Tripping is a tedious, dated, muddled and totally forgettable misfire.<br /><br />Young hitch-hikers Gary (Michael Burns) and Chay (Meg Foster) make their way around California together, hitching rides when they can and spending evenings under the stars. Gary is a kid from a decent background and a home in Connecticut who has chosen to postpone going to college in order to ""discover himself""; Chay is a more freewheeling type who just wants to experience the here-and-now while she is still young. During their wanderings, Gary and Chay come across various weird types and sometimes find themselves caught up in bizarre adventures. They're picked up by road-racers Smitty (Bruce Dern) and Simp (Larry Hankin) who threatens them with a switchblade; later they hitch a lift from an embittered woman (Joyce Van Patten) who has hated hippies since her daughter ran away to become one; another time Chay finds herself being ogled by a middle-aged trucker (Mike Conrad); and in their final ""thumb trip"", they find themselves travelling with dysfunctional husband-and-wife alcoholics (Mariana Hill and Burke Burns).<br /><br />The episodes come and go without leaving much of an impression, partly due to the fuzzy soundtrack (which renders much of the dialogue inaudible) and partly because of the thoroughly uninteresting main characters. Michael Burns gives a non-performance that may one day be recommended by doctors as a cure for insomnia, while Foster fares little better as a dislikable female lead whose character seems to think she's free and happy but in reality is just a self-centred slut. The gallery of background characters are far more fascinating than these two, but they come and go too quickly to make much of an impact. The script (by Don Mitchell, from his own novel) has no idea where it's going and merely ambles along from one pointless situation to another. Where Easy Rider was similarly plot less and freewheeling, at least it had interesting characters and situations, and charismatic performers. Thumb Tripping has none of that and is a very tough film to endure from low-key beginning to unsatisfying end."
10360_0,"Bert Hughes is home alone in his Manhattan apartment,trying to work out a major change in his trust company when a noisy rat starts scratching around his periphery and he becomes obsessed with exterminating it.By the time Hughes is through,his whole apartment is nearly exterminated-and his friends are keeping their distance due to his rat-mania.Pretty suspenseful and effective rat invasion flick with terrific central performance of Peter Weller.Several memorable moments were the diner table discussion turned to rats and everyone felt uncomfortable;and the end battle with the rat.There are also some very effective jump scenes that were finding the cat on top of the refrigerator and the toilet scene.Overall,""Of Unknown Origin"" is a fine animal attack film that deserves rediscovery.8 out of 10."
10405_0,"A simple movie but executed with style and a flair of direction has exalted this to a cult status along with the Alien. Predator is infused with elements of sci-fi, horror, and action adventure and primarily is the sole reason why it is still a beloved among hard-core action fans. The inclusion of mega star Arnold Schwarzenegger and vivid supporting casts definitely adds to that.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is that there is hardly a single dead moment in it. Every scene builds on the previous one and raises the stakes; keeping the pace of the film on its momentum. The tension is initiated there among the characters once they discover the wreckage of the crash and the gruesome sight of the dead body in the tree. The fear of the unknown has begun and sustains throughout their hunt.<br /><br />Not many films can capture such a rich tapestry of action, suspense, comedy and just plain old popcorn fun in one film. The special effects at that time were top notch and well deserved of the Oscar nomination and even today it still has the contemporary look and feel. The atmosphere of the film sets it apart from the other action oriented by being unpretentious and accepting at face value that this is purely action driven.<br /><br />The ultimate display of creativeness of vivid imagination from the effects crew is the Predator when revealed in full glory. A sight to behold! The imagery has now become an instant classic in similar veins that did for the Alien creature.<br /><br />Downright, the Predator is a thriller that entertains while being slick and fun with rousing tension."
10450_0,"Best show ever. the characters are awesome. my favorites are Cassie the witch and Thelma the lesbian ghost. but Azazel is hot. watch it because it would be like nothing you've ever seen before. who ever came up with the idea is a genius. the chemistry between characters it fantastic. you might recognize Cassie from ""what a girl wants"", this is a major step up for her and she is a great actor and should get more offers after this show. Thelma is also not a new face, she was is in the famous five movies. as the tom-boy George (georgina).its nice to see her with a change of clothes and looking more like a girl. Azazel is a hunk of gorgeous man. he is the fallen angel who is working with the devil against god. this show has a brilliant plot and I'm gonna keep watching"
10496_0,"What were they thinking? This movie is geared to the typical Seasame Street set of 2 to 8 year olds. Although the story line deals with lessons in sharing, we see Elmo lose his blanket to an evil fellow in Grouchland. If your kids have a favorite blanket this will hit too close to home. The producers added commentary by Bert and Ernie after the movie proved too frightening. The Bert and Ernie bits do lighten things up a bit but it is too scary. The movie has the usual great sets, puppets etc. but it is not for the 2 to 8 year old set. Go figure."
10540_0,"Prince of Persia - The Two Thrones was one of the most anticipated games of 2005, and one of the most disappointing for me. A good overall game that brings very little freshness to the scene.<br /><br />UbiSoft should definitely be praised for the upgrades this game has brought compared to the previous titles. Graphically, the game looks and plays much smoother, but there are no real new technical enhancements to speak of.<br /><br />The music also returns to a much more Persian feel, compared to Warrior Within. A feature that 99% of the fans might consider an improvement... but I'm part of the 1%. As an overall aesthetic choice, it does bring more immersiveness to the environment, but since 50% of the action takes place while you chop off the heads off random creatures, the metal beat of WW just felt more adequate (imo).<br /><br />The Dark Prince also brings about a new dynamic to the world, as the often humorous verbal encounters between the Prince and his corrupted self caused me to stop playing for a minute or two, just to better enjoy their bickering. Rick Miller is to be commended for brining the Prince's dark persona to life.<br /><br />What I didn't really enjoy about the game on the other hand... would be a bit more controversial. Yuri Lowenthal for example. Don't get me wrong, his voice acting is top-notch, what really disappointed me is that I was expecting to see a much more mature Prince in this third and final installment. Instead, I was treated with a 'younger' Prince of both voice and behavior. I understand how he went through a rough time in Warrior Within, and after his victory over death he felt free once again... but it just felt like he went from 18 (Sands of Time) to 24 (Warrior Within) back to 18 in Two Thrones. It didn't feel right.<br /><br />One other criticism I have is the speed kill system. Although an interesting concept, it was rather poorly executed, from several standpoints. Firstly, it is painfully repetitive. Fight 5-10 creatures, and you already got enough of it. Not to mention that it's incredibly frustrating to screw up a speed kill, and then be forced to fight your target with the incredibly ineffective dagger, from which the targets take no damage. Bosses liven things up a bit, since most of them are a bit more dynamic, but the bosses are so few and far between it didn't really feel like the trade-off of 5 hours of repetitive gameplay to get me to one dynamic part was worth it. A system where I could be able to build my own combos would of been orgasmic, but I guess that's just too much wishful thinking.<br /><br />My last criticism would be pointed at the game's linearity. Throughout development, we were promised free-roaming through the streets of Babylon. What we were served was one of the most linear experiences in the past 2-3 years in video games. Oh, and the game itself is so criminally short it can be finished in 5 hours, whereas Warrior Within or Sands of Time take a solid 10+ hours.<br /><br />Overall it was as good a game as the other Prince of Persia titles, one of the best of 2005 as well, but it was much less than we were promised, and WAY LESS than I had anticipated. For all the praise it got, it makes me wonder about the gaming community.<br /><br />(Edited on 2nd December 2008, original on Febuary 2006)"
10586_0,"Slipstream obviously is a bad movie. Now there are two types of bad movies. The first is of the Steven Seagal-category: meant to be cheap fun, and that's what it is. Poor film-making, but somehow fun to watch. The second category is where Slipstream fits into: meant to be original, innovative and artful yet all you get is mere pretentious junk. A Steven Seagal-picture knows it's terrible but doesn't want to be any more than terrible. Slipstream tries to be terrific but is actually the opposite, so in the end it's annoying as hell. The whole movie you're thinking: whoever made this should be sent to prison for insulting the intelligence of man. To sum up some of the things that went wrong with this flick: 1) the director uses all kinds of advanced techniques, mostly derived from The Matrix, for no purpose at all (a little like Swordfish but a thousand times worse), 2) the acting is totally unconvincing, people dying everywhere and the protagonists behaving like nothing is the matter, 3) huge plot holes everywhere, 4) an incredible load of editing errors, 5) everything is ripped from other movies, 6) this is the worst thing I've ever seen, 7) you shouldn't watch it, 8) forget all the positive comments around here. Thank you."
10630_0,"David Niven is an isolated concert pianist who is swept into the lives of apartment house residents in ""A Kiss in the Dark,"" also starring Jane Wyman. Niven is excellent as a man who knows no other world than that of the concert stage and the practice room, and his handlers like it that way. When an apartment manager visits him, Niven learns that one of his investments is The Cleopatra Apartments. One look at Jane Wyman in her shorts and Niven decides not to be an absentee landlord.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining comedy, and I agree with previous posters that there are laugh out loud scenes. Some of the comedy is provided by, of all people, Broderick Crawford as a subletter who works at night and sleeps -- or tries to -- all day. It's a different role for Crawford, and he does it very well.<br /><br />Wyman is very pretty and vivacious as an apartment dweller who falls for Niven, and the two have wonderful chemistry. Handsome Wayne Morris is her insurance salesman boyfriend. This isn't the most fabulous film you'll ever see, but it's a fun one."
10676_0,"I flicked on the show one Saturday, and I must say, it was horrible. I found my self thinking, ""Wow, are these professional actors or bums off the street? The cast was unbelievable, and it was quite obvious who the phantom was. Also, terrible plot. I mean come on people giant balloons causing havoc? Wow. <br /><br />I could not believe that stupid phantom. His laugh was obviously not by the actor, it was the laughter in a can. Really people, is it such a big deal that some guy turned on a fan in a movie? Even a maximum fan wouldn't have that effect.<br /><br />If you're looking for an hour to kill and you enjoy cheesy movies, this is the one for you. Look for bad acting by the whole cast."
10720_0,"Forget the other comments above. This movie is great, especially if you have ever been involved with any musical theatre in your life.<br /><br />This young troop of actors did an outstanding job, and I guarantee that at least four of them will go on to huge careers. Tiffany Taylor, Daniel Letterle especially turned out wonderful performances. <br /><br />It's been playing quite often on WAM and I find myself sitting through it every time it's on. I have yet to get tired of this movie. <br /><br />The musical numbers were fantastic!<br /><br />I get chills watching Tiffany Taylor sing ""Here's Where I Stand"" near the end of the film. And if you aren't moved by the drag party the campers hold for Michael, you're just dead inside. Dead I say."
10766_0,"It is a mystery to why I bothered even watching this film because I knew perfectly well that any film shown at 3 o'clock is not going to be remotely entertaining. For a lack of anything better to do (this has to be the only reason for anyone watching it), I sat down and tried to take in this tripe.<br /><br />First of all, it is obvious that it is trying too hard to be funny and is blatantly copying features of respectable films e.g. SHREK and THE EXORCIST. Punchlines are too obvious, these half-baked jokes are unbearable and you wonder if the producers even bothered thinking about how the plot works. Also, someone in the production is totally obsessed with slapping people.<br /><br />I feel pity on the main character for being so embarrassing. He deserves better! Even though I have been only exposed to mostly decent films, this has to be one of the worst movies of all time."
10810_0,"Though I wouldn't expect it at all, this was indeed a good movie. It has his problems (the teenagers are annoying as always, the dialoguse have major problems and the werewolf is not done very good), but you can surely pass over. The very good points: 1. The werewolf is quite crazy. He tears apart his victims, he IS a beast. 2. The werewolf is talking! This is ingenious indeed, I never saw it before, and I saw a lot of werewolf movies. You may think at first it is inappropriate, but I assure you the effect overall is very good. 3. There are pleasant nudity scenes, great tits, and the werewolf even rapes one of the teengirls in her perfect ass, in front of her boyfriend. While rather disturbing, the scene is quite good and adds to the story. 4. The atmosphere is nicely done, quite dark, quite 80's and there IS suspense. I am surely recommend the movie as one of the few werewolf movies made good in the last decades, with Ginger Snaps Unleashed and Dog Soldiers being other two examples in the same vein."
10856_0,"""The Fury"" is another underrated thriller from Brian DePalma, the ""Master of the Macabre"" (a title he earned, in my opinion). This film actually owes little to Hitchcock, other than a few directorial touches. DePalma here creates a dazzling original, with superb special effects and strong acting and a solid plot.<br /><br />""The Fury"" shares a few similarities with DePalma's previous film ""Carrie"". It is based on a best seller (by John Farris, who adapted his novel). Both films feature Amy Irving, then a newcomer to films. Both deal with psychics and telekinesis. And both are strong character studies grafted onto a thriller. <br /><br />""The Fury"" is a great deal more complicated in terms of the storyline than ""Carrie"" was. The film stars Kirk Douglas in a strong performance as a government agent whose son (a psychic) was kidnapped. John Cassavetes plays the kidnapper, who happens to be Douglas' partner (all these connections are established within the first 20 minutes, so I'm not spoiling it for you) The bulk of the film deals with Gillian (Amy Irving), another psychic who Douglas enlists to find his son. Over the course of the film, there are a great many surprises and revelations that DePalma just throws at the viewer. But don't worry about being confused. DePalma makes everything clear as it progresses.<br /><br />""The Fury"" finds DePalma working with mostly new collaborators, although a few (editor Paul Hirsch and some of the actors)are DePalma veterans. Despite the change, the technical credits are still first rate. The cinematographer is Richard H. Kline, who has shot many different kinds of films (exploitation, Hollywood, independent) and his photography is excellent, with great use of shadows and light. The score is by John Williams (famous for ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"" and many, many Hollywood films) and it is an extremely effective one, but one wonders if Pino Donaggio might have done a better job (especially after his mesmerizing work in ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Carrie"" and especially ""Blow Out""). But still, I want to say that Williams' score is very good, especially towards the films' climatic moments. And Paul Hirsch's editing accomplishes exactly what it did for ""Carrie"".<br /><br />The acting is first rate as well. Kirk Douglas gives his usual strong performance and I go on record as saying that he is one of our most overlooked actors. John Cassavetes makes a memorable villain and although this job was most likely for the money (he acted to finance his own films; this job probably financed ""Gloria""), he doesn't sleepwalk through his role unlike some actors. Charles Durning returns as another villain, adding to his collection of offbeat and memorable performances (The Muppet Movie added another)and Amy Irving is very good as the psychic who helps Douglas. And if you pay close attention, you'll see Bill Finley in a cameo in the first 12 minutes or so. (And if you pay really close attention, you'll see Jim Belushi)<br /><br />As is the case with most DePalma thrillers, ""The Fury"" has a wow of an ending. It is probably the greatest of the DePalma endings, one of such satisfaction and plausibility that you won't stop talking about it for hours after the film is over. There is a deliberate pace and some of the middle scenes are sluggish, but fortunately, they don't last long and DePalma gives us our money's worth. ""The Fury"" is not the best of the DePalma thrillers (""Dressed to Kill"" gets my vote), but it is an excellent film that combines intelligence and craftmanship. It is a must see.<br /><br />**** out of 4 stars"
10900_0,"This show is by far the funniest thing I have seen on TV in a very long time. The concept of the show is genius, and the acting and props are all so perfectly bad (in a good way). The way they spoof the various 80's hospital dramas,actions shows, and blend them with some b-movie horror w/ some low budget sci-fi thrown in, is just amazing and works so well. The over-dramatics, the intentionally bad acting, the low budget look, and the interludes with the actors speaking about their vision for the show, blends into this comedic over the top, ridiculousness. Every line in this is either a hilarious well placed cliché, a silly premise, or utter silliness, all perfectly coming together to make a spoof piece that lampoons a variety of eighties shows and kept me entertained laughing out loud. It is also one of the most quotable shows ever. It is like the Spinal Tap of 80's television. The show is done so well, with every subtle little thing imaginable thrown in. You can watch it over and over and find even more jokes. Everyone who has a dark sense of humor needs to watch DARKPLACE."
10946_0,"OK, maybe I'm giving in to nostalgia here but I rented ""Footloose"" recently and thought it was great. Yes, it's definitely a teen flick, similar to ""Dirty Dancing"", and aging a little now.<br /><br />But the music is great and the plot and themes do as much for me as ""Grease"" ever did. As teen movies go, it is somewhat original and interesting.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- Teens with nothing better to do on a rainy day<br /><br />-- People reliving the 1980s, you won't be disappointed to<br /><br />see this one again<br /><br />I'll give Footloose a 9 out of 10 because it cheered me up on a day I needed it."
10991_0,"First off, this is NOT as good as the movie ""Beautiful Thing""--the other British film about gay teens. But it still works wonderfully on its own terms.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted by the whole cast and the story is realistic (unfortunately) and true to life. Some people have complained that the interactions between the two boys keep running hot and cold way too often. Well welcome to real life! I know of similar situations with friends and this movie captured them perfectly. Also the isolation and longing of the gay boy was so accurate. There's a sequence at a dance when the two boys are staring longingly at each other while dancing with two women they couldn't care less about. That scene brought tears to my eyes! Also when the gay teen tells off the guy he's in love with and the closing scene (don't want to give it away) were also extremely powerful and honest. The film also ends realistically BUT not depressingly. Also, the film IS funny. It's not a comedy, but it does have its light moments. See it! It's well worth 8 or 9 bucks.<br /><br />"
11035_0,"The late Craig Russell is the star of Outrageous! It was a cult favorite here in the Boston area, playing for weeks at the late lamented Orson Welles Cinema. I had a bright red T-shirt with the movie logo on the front that I treasured for years.<br /><br />First and foremost, the film is a document of his brilliant performances; he not only got the look and mannerisms of his subjects down cold, he also spoke and sung all the voices himself!<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, is a tale about his attempts to become a successful performer, and about his schizophrenic friend and how he and she support and heal each other. It's not bad, but the performances are the heart and soul of the film.<br /><br />Outrageous! was long out of print; happily for the world, it's available again. Get it while you can."

As for the comments about the extreme differences between the characters, have they not heard the old adage that ""truth is stranger thatn fiction?""<br /><br />I love this movie, pure and simple.

11125_0,"Two loving parents feed their happy baby on the perch of their country home. It is often said that these early Lumiere shorts are primitive because they have not yet mastered basic film grammar, such as camera movement, editing or the close-up, films like these being a simple, static set-u;, the camera pointing at the scene from a middle distance. But as filmmakers like Godard, Ozu and Kitano, for instance, realised, that very grammar can be a violation of the integrity of the image, forcing us to concentrate of the structure in which the image is only a unit, rather than the image itself.<br /><br />There is nothing primitive or simple about this particular image; as critics have noted, this film offers two levels of movement, one human, recognisable, communal (the family); the other (the trees blowing) part of a different order altogether, of nature, cycles, immemoriality. So while the family represents a similar idea of continuity as the trees, of the species being reproduced, it sis also offered in stark contraast to them, as each member of the trio will eventually die, for all the nourishment and fertility, while nature lives on, indifferent.<br /><br />This frisson of mortality undercuts the film's essential conservatism, and differentiates it from the sinister surveillance of the earlier 'Sortie d'Usine'. This recognition that the powers of the camera-wielding Lumieres are in fact limited, that they are not as omniscient as they once thought they were, is perhaps dramatised in the figure of the father, one of the brothers, one of the first great director-stars, paving the way for Chaplin, Keaton and Welles. His crossing the line from director to star, from passive to active, from subject to object, represents a breach between the observer and observed, a breaking of that invisible line, a destruction of that contract Hollywood will try so desperately to enforce, between reality and fiction. The watcher is now the watched, distinctions and hierarchies have been abolished.<br /><br />Ironically, immortality has been conversely guarenteed - while the man behind the camera is lost, fading into a mere eye, a role taken over by every viewer, the actor brother is trapped forever in this rigid, simple domestic scenario, feeding the ever-hungry, unthinking baby, a harbinger of the medium he invented."
11170_0,"A universal story based on so many peoples lives, their first love, life experiences, growing up and most importantly discovering who loves them the most. It's about being young and feeling all those wonderful undiscovered feeling that we all humans feel for the first time. It's joyous to watch and reminisent about your own life as well as experiencing those moments one more time. After all we only live once."
11215_0,Recently was on Encore again. Vintage Maryam D'Abo. Why the owners refuse to release this on DVD given the large cult following I will never know. Some years ago I suggested another movie on DVD. The studio didn't think there would ever be a market for it. They have made more on the DVD than they made in the theaters by several times. (A Kelsey Grammar film) <br /><br />Something is out there was released in Australia on a rather pathetic VHS tape. This film deserves digital re-mastering and the DVD treatment. This made for NBC mini-series was outstanding. The later series... <br /><br />The movie could have been better if it had been done as a theatrical release instead of TV. D'Abo is a much better actress than she ever gets credit for. <br /><br />Whoever needs to get them to release this film for serious collectors.
11260_0,"There aren't many films of this genre (the late night TV film/filmfour film) which will grip you like this film does. I think, literally, I spent about half an hour in the doorway to the lounge, trying to leave the room in order to make a drink... but my eyes were fixed to the screen, and my feet fixed to the floor.<br /><br />I think this film speaks to you in a way you can't describe, you are along for the ride and you have bought 100% into the characters (save one 'baddy') - the director/cast/et al managed to produce something greater than the sum of it's parts. The film is fantastic and yet some of the parts really shouldn't add up to something so good.<br /><br />Excellent for what it is. Those who like to go on an emotional journey, a journey with the characters, an unpleasant and sometimes pillow-gripping journey, but a rewarding one none-the-less."

Leading character Anna, a hard-working wife and mother of two daughters, has always wanted to be a writer. But her work, husband and two daughters have always stood between her and her passion. A sick daughter, an unfaithful husband, a demanding old mother, and her own social commitment make it hard for her to sit down and write her autobiography. Then dramatic events make her realize that she has only one mission: to be a writer, to finally live! ('Leef'!) Several different sub-stories develop and finally come together in a breathtaking, jubilant climax. Award-winning script-writer Maria Goos is at her best here, and so is director Willem van de Sande-Bakhuysen, who was terminally ill when the shooting started and who died shortly after 'Live! was completed."
11350_0,"I enjoyed this more then the first. There was no slapstick comedy which really teed me off in the first film. Although there was a clear leader, it was more balanced on a party of characters. It was more of what I would expect from a D&D movie. The action was well paced, and the plot progressed well. The SFX were decent. A few times the CG wasn't that good but it didn't really detract that much. Ellie Chidzley as Lux was very easy on the eyes. Hope to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />In overall context of movies maybe 6.5/10. In the context of a D&D movie and to those looking for one I give it 8/10.<br /><br />Worth a view."
11396_0,"Arctic climes didn't do Sean Connery's initially troubled post-Bond career any favours, although his top billing in The Red Tent is highly misleading, since his supporting role is not much more than a cameo. Instead, forth-billed (after Claudia Cardinale and Hardy Kruger) Peter Finch takes the lead as General Nobile, whose ill-fated 1928 airship expedition to the North Pole, intended to boost Fascist Italy's international prestige, instead ended ingloriously with the survivors stranded on melting ice packs for weeks while inertia, lack of initiative and the poor chain of command resulted in buck-passing, recriminations and destroyed reputations rather than rescue attempts. The real-life disaster was the inspiration for Frank Capra's Dirigible (Capra and studio boss Harry Cohn were both huge admirers of Mussolini in the early days), but this ambitious Russian-Italian co-production is best remembered, if at all, for either its catastrophic box-office failure or its unusual framing structure. Although unusual may be an understatement: in a move more akin to theatre of the 60s rather than epic cinema, it begins with the ageing Nobile, tormented by another sleepless night, summoning up the ghosts of those involved in the disaster and the rescue to put his command on trial.<br /><br />As a dramatic device, it's too theatrical to entirely work, especially in the clumsy opening reel, but it impinges little on the main drama once the film gets going and ultimately pays dividends, both in the stark poetry and terrible beauty of a scene where Connery's Roald Amundsen recounts his own death and in the final moments which come to some kind of peace with the issues of responsibility, human fallibility and forgiveness. But it's the survival story that works best, with director Mickail K. Kalatozov often eschewing the spectacle (airship and plane crashes, icebreakers and vast landscapes of ice) with a preference for medium shots that keep the film surprisingly intimate (unusually for such an expensive picture, it is also shot in the more confined 1.78:1 ratio rather than Scope).<br /><br />I can't answer for its historical accuracy beyond Connery's philosophical Amundsen being nothing like the ruthless egomaniac of reality that he had become by this time (indeed, Amundsen's death in this rescue did much to salvage his heroic reputation after the public backlash to his bitter score-settling memoirs). However, far from having to be persuaded to join the rescue attempts, Amundsen had immediately volunteered only for Mussolini to specifically insist he be excluded because of his earlier public disputes with Nobile in the aftermath of their previous expedition, leaving Amundsen to finance his rescue attempt privately. Nor was Amundsen reluctant to return to the Arctic: shortly before the opportunity arose, he said that he wanted to go back and die there ""in the fulfilment of a high mission, quickly, without suffering."" (The fact that he was undergoing painful radium treatment at the time may have colored his words.) Poetic license aside, it is surprising that the political fallout is not dealt with more overtly - it was a huge national embarrassment that Il Duce's heroes had to be rescued by Russian communists. Indeed, the film is almost totally apolitical, with Il Duce mentioned only once in passing in the opening newsreel footage. However, as a drama it's unsensationally compelling, and Ennio Morricone's score is one of his best.<br /><br />Paramount's widescreen R1 DVD transfer is pretty good but sadly lacking in any extras."
11440_0,"I saw ""Into Great Silence"" the other day. I was frustrated, in no small measure by its length. (DVT is a worrisome byproduct.) OK, to the degree that the film provoked me to think and question and puzzle about my frustration and the silent life of these monks, it succeeded. But, I'm not convinced it's an important contribution to any deeper understanding of the solitude and great silence that is the life force of Grande Chartreuse. And that, I feel, is a failing.<br /><br />On reflection, solitude is what this ""meditation"" is attempting to get at. Yes, silence is key to solitude. But the title of the film misleads. And because there is no attempt to explain the Carthusian vocation/way of life, viewers are left to learn this on their own. In the end, the film short-changes viewers  and the monks. It's way too personal to have the impact that the filmmaker apparently intended. Understanding monastic life, especially early in the 21st century, would be a welcome antidote to the barrage of messages, sounds, and images that assault us daily. But this film misses the mark. So, I'm not ungrateful  just disappointed."
11486_0,"I'm sorry but saying this movie sucks is an understatement, the beginning and the ends were good, stay awake for the ending, despite the boring inbetween stuff, but don't miss the odd stuff inbetween it was either humorus, or gothic in a way. I can stay awake through anything, even HobGoblins, this is a great movie for animation lovers, definitely not for kids, but still this was a good animation."
11530_0,"BUCK PRIVATES was the second movie with Abbott and Costello. In the first, ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS, the boys were purely there for comic relief and played a very small part in the film. They didn't even bother creating characters for them, as each went by their real names. While in BUCK PRIVATES their roles are thankfully bigger, they still are in supporting roles--though the studio stuck their names at the top of the credits to capitalize on their success in the last film. Despite the billing, Lee Bowman and Alan Curtis played the real leads in the film. This, combined with lots of singing and a romance in which neither Abbott nor Costello is involved with is why BUCK PRIVATES really can't be among the team's best films. It's very good, but far from perfect.<br /><br />The film begins with rich blow-hard Bowman getting a draft notice. Since he's so spoiled, he assumes his family will pull some strings to get him either out of the military altogether or into officer's training school. But, his father sees things differently--boot camp and serving as an enlisted man will be a great chance to teach him character. Along the way, he and Curtis vie for the same girl and are rivals throughout the film.<br /><br />Abbott and Costello join the army--mostly because they are running from the cops. Naturally, Costello ends up being the lamest excuse for a soldier there is and if the US military REALLY had accepted such cretins in the service, they would have undoubtedly lost WWII! There were several good skits involving the boys and while not their best work, it still is pretty fresh and well worth watching.<br /><br />In addition to all this, the Andrews Sisters are on hand to sing. Some may love their songs, such as the famous ""Boogie, Woogie Bugle Boy"", but as for me, I thought the music was a huge distraction and I sped through these numbers--I'd already heard them when I'd seen the movie when I was a kid--and I'd already suffered enough! Why, oh why, did studios insist on saddling comedies with singing in the 30s, 40s and 50s?! Overall, a much better script than the last film but the duo still take a backseat to the action. Good, but they were capable of better.<br /><br />By the way, in the comedy boxing scene, Lou Costello probably had to work hard to look bad, as in real life he had been a boxer in his youth--and a pretty good one from what I've read."
11576_0,"I haven't seen every single Agatha Christie adaptation, of course, but I know that ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is considered by most fans to be the best of them all. I believe that ""Death on the Nile"" in a vastly superior film, for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Ustinov is a much better Poirot than the cold and dislikable Albert Finney. Ustinov combines intelligence and sweetness in the role, and the scenes where he displays Poirot's vanity (""I leave luck to others!"") are hilarious.<br /><br />2) The logic in this movie is flawless and everything is CLEARLY explained, while in ""Murder in the Orient Express"" Poirot reached many ARBITRARY conclusions. You won't guess either ending, but it takes a brilliant person (like Poirot) to guess the ending here, while it takes a magician to guess the ending there.<br /><br />3) ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is somewhat claustrophobic, while ""Death on the Nile"" contains many more scenes filmed in beautiful natural locations. Visually, it's a much more pleasing film.<br /><br />""Death on the Nile"" has only one serious flaw: its overlength. But it's still an unpredictable, highly enjoyable film, and the scene where Poirot reveals everything is so perfectly done that you'll want to watch it again and again."
11620_0,"One of the smartest, funniest, and exciting buddy pictures ever made. It has never received the wonderful attention it justly deserves. The performances by the two leads (De Niro and Grodin) are wonderful and they get outstanding support from Joe Pantolino, Dennis Farina, and Yaphet Kotto. But what separates this picture from all the other action / comedies ever made is that the screenplay is so sharp and original. Easily my all time favorite movie - you know how I know that? I must have seen ""Midnight Run"" at least thirty times and every time I see it, it gets better and better. A true film classic and is getting rereleased on DVD in June of 2003."
11666_0,"A SINGLE GIRL (Benoît Jacquot - France 1995).<br /><br />A little known gem with the beautiful Virginie Ledoyen in the lead. I have a special relation with some films and this is certainly one of them. I first saw it - not long after it came out - on Dutch public television in my final year in high school. I thought the girl in the main role (Virginie Ledoyen) was the coolest girl I ever saw and the film always stuck with me. Later on, largely due to her performance in this film, she would become a big star and continued to be in the limelight and even played alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in THE BEACH (2000), so that's probably why I kept remembering her role in LA SEULE FILLE.<br /><br />For a large part, the film plays in real time as the camera follows Valérie on the day she finds out she's pregnant. She starts a new job in a hotel as a maid. Her day-to-day routines are followed, her various encounters with the hotel guests and her intermittent meetings with her boyfriend at a nearby café. He doesn't know how to handle the situation, he doesn't have a job and cannot seem to make up his mind about anything, let alone this situation. He is a bit of a loser. Off course Valérie is in the toughest spot but somehow she never ceases to lose control or overview of the situation. She is on screen all the time as the camera follows her constantly while she walks down the corridors of the hotel, in the elevator, walking down the streets. Even though she has an attitude, is arrogant and acts a bit too wise for a girl her age, she remains absolutely fascinating throughout the film.<br /><br />The lack of plot hardly mattered to me, because it's compensated by Virginie Ledoyen's radiant presence. This is the perfect example of a film where one actor or actress completely makes it work.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 9/10"
11710_0,"Cary Grant is absolutely brilliant in this movie and lets it work out as a fun romantic comedy. He is great as a man who is giving his ex-wife to be a hard time, when she gets engaged to a rich southern oil man. In the end the roles get turned around and the Irene Dunn character gets to give the Grant character a hard time. It makes this a rather fun movie to watch, though I wouldn't call it Leo McCarey's finest movie but that says something more about his qualities than that of this actual movie.<br /><br />It has a fun typical 1930's genre story and the movie can be seen as a screwball comedy, though its not the best genre example of it, since the movie besides its screwball elements also feature many other, more subtle, comedy styles. It sort is too bad though that the actors obviously had to improvise at times. It gives the movie a sort of a realistic look into how Cary Grant and Irene Dunn worked as actors but it doesn't always provide the movie with some much needed great witty dialog and fine written comedy moments. Sometimes the directing and editing feels like it was done too hasty, with at times as a result an end result that isn't quite what it should had and could had been. Nevertheless Leo McCarey still received an Oscar for his directing of this movie. It was the only Oscar the movie won as well but it was nominated in 5 more categories though, including best picture of the year.<br /><br />But no I don't want to let this movie sound bad, for it really is a movie which I enjoyed watching. Its characters, its story and its actors simply make sure that this is a movie to enjoy.<br /><br />8/10"
11756_0,"[MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS]<br /><br /> The Newton family is back and so is Beethoven. It's been a while since their last adventure. One particular morning, after Beethoven is awakened from his dream of steaks, he walks himself around the park and notices a female St. Bernard. Her name is Missy. She and her owner were buying ice cream, but right at that moment, a woman who's quite nasty and has no heart for dogs shows up. Her name is Regina. She was married to Missy's owner until they got a divorce, so Regina feels she has the right to take the dog. So she does. Then she and her dimwited boyfriend Floyd take off. But Beethoven knows where they've taken Missy and everyday he goes to visit. Ted and Emily follow him one day and see that Beethoven and Missy have had puppies. They take the puppies with them so they won't be discovered by Regina. The kids hide the puppies in the basement, but also learn they won't eat. Their only hope is to do it manually with a veterenarian's perscription. Only problem: they've got to do it more than once, so they wake up early in the morning and cut classes. Alice finds out about why that is happening, and also finds out about the puppies. She says not to tell George. But George eventually finds out and says they cannot keep them. But of course, sympathy worked and the puppies were allowed to stay.<br /><br />The kids named them: Dolly, Chubby, Tchikowski, and Mo. The puppies really grow on the family. I mean they get real big and constantly get on George's nerves. Also, the family will be taking a vacation in the mountains so they must bring all the dogs with them. It's a nice cabin. But someone else was also up there. Regina and Floyd. They're hiding out, as it were. Ryce meets a new boyfriend who treats her like nothing, so she meets another one and he's much nicer. They go to the county fair the following day where George get's signed up for an eating contest, involving eating the most burgers in only a few minutes. He and Beethoven did it. Then, Regina showed up and snatched the puppies and took them into the mountains. Beethoven and Missy followed, so did the Newtons. There's a showdown in the mountains, and soon Regina and Floyd fall into the river and are given the ride they deserve. Some months later, back at home, Missy's old owner shows up and says everything is fine and Regina get's nothing. He also asks to see the ""kids"", so George, Alice, and Beethoven call the enourmous puppies downstairs.<br /><br /> Just as good as the first. I recommend this movie. If you liked the first one, you will like this one. See it when you can. +"
11800_0,"I get so tired seeing heroin thin, twenty-somethings in romantic comedies, especially ones with lots of nudity. This one has the luminous Susie Porter reclining, pacing and prancing around nude, with the most fantastic confidence and comfort with her body. She doesn't have the perfect body mind you, but the type that I love more than a Hagen-Daz milkshake. She's got some meat on her bones, but she isn't fat. She is voluptuous, curvaceous, with the sweetest milky white, freckled skin. Her smile can take your breath away, and her eyes seem like they can see every lie you've ever told, and you want her to know. She's a WOMAN, a real woman, not some kid trying to be a woman. Most times with *women* you get lots of trying to be younger, but Susie LIVES in her body, her soul is older, wiser and more mature. She knows how to treat a man too. She lets a guy be a guy without sacrificing her will or self-esteem. Oh, I'm supposed to review this movie... OK...<br /><br />Basically in this excellent flick you are watching two adults fall in love. Both are mature and confident, but they're leery of jumping into a relationship, but it never lingers on past baggage, and nobody needs to ""get free"" of some obstacle before they can continue. I've found that women rarely say they're ready for love, or looking for love, but if it presents itself to them they won't chase it off. Basically a woman is never NOT ready to fall in love, and this movie does a great job of showing men how a woman who isn't even THINKING about falling in love, can. It also illustrates luxuriously how head games, lies and bullsh*t are NOT the way to enjoy falling in love. Most young people think that head games are the only way to get what you want, or how to protect your heart, which is toss-all. Here two people say what they mean and mean what they say, and what they don't say they don't say because they're not sure yet that they feel it.<br /><br />Have you ever met someone and it just clicked and while it was clicking you spent a day or three in bed? This movie sumptuously wallows in that intoxicating experience. These two people devour each other sexually and while they do, passion blossoms and intimacy becomes more and more desirable. I can't remember a movie that so eloquently illustrates the difference between lust and passion, between sex and intimacy.<br /><br />Buy this movie now, you will not regret it, but watch it with a lover because watching it while you're single will make you jones too much for the real thing and that could be depressing. View it with someone you love and it could re-kindle a little magic, it will at least get you laughing and getting aroused in the same room.<br /><br />A movie about adults for adults that makes you feel like a kid."
11846_0,"I was a bit surprised by the sometimes frank and honest dialog coming from Aoi Miyazaki's character in what for the most part is a very family friendly bit of Japanese young love/first love cinema. But it is appropriate for her character, a set-to-mature-at-any-moment young woman deficient in some necessary growth hormones needed to push her over the edge (that when triggered by a first kiss could ultimately be her ... undoing) and seems trapped in young adolescence. It's a very cute and cute-funny, and really sad, sad, film. Miyazaki teeters the edge between coy and seductive so well it made me dizzy ... with delight. I could, however, understand her pouty lipped attempts at cuteness turning some folks off. She does slip out of it each time very quickly, though. That's part of her charm, I guess.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed. The 'heavenly' forest is fairy-tale gorgeous, as are the three young actors we spend time with. The story is engaging too, clearly a novel-adapted one."
11891_0,"I remember seeing Goodbye My Lady back when I was a lad as the second part of a double feature. I was pretty amazed at this most unusual canine.<br /><br />Young Skeeter, who lives with his Uncle Jesse in the swamp area near Pascagoula, Mississippi comes upon a most unusual dog in the swamp. It grooms itself like a cat, has a hyena like laugh instead of a bark, and has the speed of Secretariat. Any kid like the one I was when I saw this would want to possess an animal like this. When Skeeter finally does capture him he finds he's got the most natural hunting dog ever seen those parts.<br /><br />Brandon DeWilde was a pretty popular child actor in the Fifties, Shane and The Member of the Wedding cemented his career. He and Walter Brennan playing Uncle Jesse are a winning combination. They get good support from Phil Harris as the local grocer, Sidney Poitier has a small role as a young black neighbor and William Hopper, the Yankee visitor from Connecticut. <br /><br />Would you believe this film was produced by John Wayne? His Batjac Production company occasionally did films that did not star the Duke. Duke got a top director in William Wellman with whom he had just finished The High and the Mighty to direct Goodbye My Lady and Phil Harris and William Hopper who was in the cast of same. Wellman mixes all the elements just right for a winning film.<br /><br />This unusual dog turns out to be a basenji from Africa and of course the dog is lost from it's real owner. The ending isn't what you would expect from a boy/dog picture, it's more real and that's as far as I go at this point.<br /><br />Living in Buffalo as I do now, there's a bit of humor here that non- Buffalonians can't appreciate. Phil Harris has a hunting dog named Millard Fillmore, named after our 13th American President. Fillmore is somewhere in the middle rank of Presidents generally, but as a native of Buffalo, you'll find a few people in this part of the world who will accord him as great. <br /><br />Harris makes a joke about nothing ever being named for Fillmore. Where I live there's a page or two in the phone book for things named Fillmore. That must have sent up a few howls back when I was a kid in theaters here."
11936_0,"The person's whose comments read ""Alien it ain't"" couldn't have been more dead on.<br /><br />The beginning of this movie starts with the girl, who is the alien in this film simply because of a slight resemblance to the blonde alien in the original (not because of ANY acting skills), is a college professor giving a lecture. She's as believable as a college professor as Steven Hawking would be playing a high school cheerleader. She looks like an 18 year old high school cheerleader. She delivers her ""lecture"" as awkwardly as it is for us to watch it. There wasn't a person in the world who bought her as a college professor including the director and herself. She gives the lecture and delivers the ""punchline"" so poorly, I knew at that point there would be no way I could finish this movie. It's insulting that anyone would think we're supposed to buy her as a college professor. It was one of the worst pieces of casting/writing I've seen this decade.<br /><br />The ""acting"" in the rest of the film, including Ben Cross's performance, was terrible, literally unwatchable. I've seen amateur performances on Youtube that were better. About 20 minutes into the movie I was just fast forwarding.<br /><br />The CGI looks like it was unfinished, like it was from 1992. There is nothing scary or tension building about anything in this movie. I wasted a Netflix rental on this garbage and was more mad at myself than anything - and mad at the rating this movie has in the IMDb (over 6 at this point - it HAS to go down). I really liked the original film. This movie should be taken off any video store shelf. It's just awful."
11981_0,"Kung Fu Hustle was one of the most visually imaginative and unique movies I have seen in quite some time. Upon first viewing the trailer, I thought we would have another Kung Pow: Enter The Fist on our hands but, boy, was I wrong. Unlike Kung Pow, the jokes did not grow tired on me and the special effects were definitely top notch. The scene with the two assassins playing that stringed instrument (don't know the name of it) in such a way that it kills was incredible.<br /><br />Although there was not much to the story, it was not non-existent, either. There was a simple story happening which made sense for what we were watching. Even the jokes with the subtitles came across as funny, and from my experience, humor does not translate as easily as this movie would have you believe. It borrowed or spoofed a bit from Spider-Man and The Matrix as well, which was a bit unexpected for this film, initially. At least for me.<br /><br />To be honest, I could enjoy this movie without sound or subtitles, too. It was that appealing to the eye. It would be a good background movie for a party or poker game which could catch your eye at any moment and still hold your attention. It could also be great if you feel like a good comedy. I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater, it held my interest all the way to the end. 9/10"
12025_0,"This is a chilling film made with minimal resources that grabs you by the jugular and doesn't let go - a family tragedy that reeks of Shakespeare. A father has died leaving two sets of sons behind (by different mothers). The older sons were abandoned when young and when they turn up at the funeral held by the younger sons, old hostilities surface. Much of the narrative unfolds without explicit explanation, and often with minimal dialogue. We get into the minds of the various protagonists largely by their actions.<br /><br />Set in the cotton-growing region of Arkansas, it gives a view of Americans struggling in semi-rural life. The film cast is mostly with unknown actors and this is a strength that adds a level of realism to a film. While there is a sense of dreaded inevitability throughout, there is also plenty of room for the unexpected, but not in a contrived Hollywood manner. The film is both very well written and impeccably directed. Remarkably, this is a directorial debut by Jeff Nichols who also wrote and produced the film. He is definitely a talent to watch.<br /><br />As a slight negative, I don't know if it was the film or the venue, but the visuals and sound didn't seem quite up to scratch. This bothered me slightly at the start, but once the story got into gear (pretty early in the piece), it was barely noticeable. I found the music enjoyable, adding ambiance without being in your face.<br /><br />I saw Shotgun Stories at the Melbourne International Film Festival."
12070_0,"Much has been written about whether the events in the movie Hidalgo are true or even feasible. Whether they are true or not is irrelevant as this is a movie made for entertainment. The cast and crew of Hidalgo have done a tremendous job of creating an entertaining and enjoyable film that is respectful of western, Sioux and Arabic cultures. The characterization of Frank Hopkins in this film is one of the best depictions of cowboy behavior in recent history. Cowboys are respectful, courteous, loyal, hard-working and yet, they do play hard. Inclusion of Lakota Sioux and Arabic dialects with large and easy-to-read English subtitles did not detract from the flow of the film. Some reviewers have commented that Mortensen mumbles too many of his lines. One that is accustomed to listening to Native American dialects might find that the softness, quietness and blending of the sounds is characteristic of this native language. The director did an excellent job in casting this diverse group of actors and each brings distinctive touches to their performance. The cinematographer should be commended for capturing the beauty of each locale, and the scenery is gorgeous. Hidalgo delivers the story of a valiant horse who happened to be owned by a man that stumbled, fell and yet through arduous effort regained his sense of self and place in the world."

I believe the show featured cartoons and kid's features, including a regular visit from a safety cop from the Toronto police corps. Off the program, he did like his ""wee drams."" I read somewhere that Uncle Bobby and CTV sportscaster Pat Marsden used to close some bars in downtown Toronto back in the late 1960s, early 1970s.<br /><br />Bimbo the clown and the birthday puppets deserve some mention here, also. What was it about hosts of kids shows in this era and their cardigan sweaters? Is there some symbolism here that is escaping me? One thing I remember that at some point, the show stopped taking itself so seriously and laughed at itself quite regularly, as the rest of us were doing. These cheap little shows were so bad, they were truly great!<br /><br />The Uncle Bobby Show was an institution here in Canada and more should be made of this talented man who came to entertain us in our living rooms every weekday."
12160_0,"Known as LONG AGO TOMORROW, THE RAGING MOON is possibly the most intriguing movie in the career of young Malcolm MacDowell. It came after his breakthrough film IF, and before the films most people recall he starred in: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and O LUCKY MAN. MacDowell is nowadays established as a well known character actor who specializes in powerful or power-mad villains for the most part. On an episode of LAW AND ORDER a few years back he was a twisted version of Rupert Murdoch. He is frequently rogue CIA agents, or tycoons with secret agendas. And he is wonderful in all these roles. But except for O LUCKY MAN it is hard to find MacDowell playing a sympathetic and simple type. His salesman in O LUCKY MAN is naive and believes what line is ever given to him by his employers. But in THE RAGING MOON he was a strong, athletic young man whose future is wrecked by a physical accident that cripples him. And he has to try to fight his anger at this unfair situation and regain his self respect.<br /><br />McDowell plays Bruce Prichard, a soccer/rugby player who is injured in a game - and left wheelchair bound at the age of 21. Given that sport was the key to his life, the props have been knocked out from underneath him in more than one way. He slowly develops into a determined man who is going to overcome his permanent handicap. What really turns him into a determined type is his meeting with another patient (also similarly crippled) named Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman). The two young people find they are encouraging each other's recovery. And sooner or later they begin falling in love.<br /><br />It is the oddest role in MacDowell's career, and he handles very well. Basically, except for the first ten minutes of the film, he is stuck in bed or in his wheelchair. He is bitter, but fixed on getting on with his new life. Andd finally he is enchanted by his new friend, confidante, and lover Newman. In one of the most touching scenes of the film, the two lovers figure out how to embrace in their wheelchairs by turning them on parallel lines to each other, and lowering the right arms of the wheelchairs so they can surround their arms about each other's waists and chests. The viewer can see the difficulties the young people will face, but they see they will do what they can to overcome their joint disability. So that the audience ends up cheering for them.<br /><br />MacDowell is not usually so sympathetic. His anti-hero in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is tormented by the state in a new process to make him an acceptable (if defenseless) citizen, and then tormented by one of his old victims. But he was a stylish but still vicious punk in most of that film. He may symbolize youthful suspicions against an antiquated establishment in IF, but he is a violent rebel in the end. And due to his crass stupidity in O LUCKY MAN he actually commits fraud. But in THE RAGING MOON he struck a different note - and it was one he rarely hit again in any films or television shows he made. <br /><br />The ultimate fate of his hero and heroine, and the cruelty of the world and nature they face, enhance the film. At the conclusion he is stunned by events. So is his audience. And nobody can explain why what happened had to be final for his dreams."
12205_0,"I loved this film, it absolutely spoke to me in a way that few films I've seen do.<br /><br />My biggest fear throughout was that at any moment the next scene would see Sam (sean Penn) and Rita the lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) deciding that the best solution to their problems would be if the both united in a marriage / pseudo-marriage, so they could lay happy families and all live happily ever after, blah balh blah ad nauseum. Thank God Nelson had more sense to drop a large hunk of semi-soft cheese into the middle of an outstanding masterpiece. Such a cliched and trite twist would have aboslutely ruined the film for me. Obviously, Nelson did not want to pedestrianise her masterpiece and so consciously steered away from such a soap-opera style conclusion.<br /><br />Penn's performance is highly commendable - more Rainman than Forest Gump. Indeed, it represents what must surely be a turning point in his career direction. Full credit also to young Dakota Fanning (Lucy) who carried off a superb portrayal of her character and simply stole the movie!<br /><br />I'll keep this short but suffice to say if you haven't seen this film you're missing something big. Not everyone will go to see this film but those who do will know that they have seen a truely magnificent piece of cinema."
12250_0,"The other night a friend stopped by with a copy of The Incorporated. I had never heard of it before and as there were no big names in it I was tempted to watch Seinfeld reruns instead. Wow. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not an independent film kind of guy. My interests usually lie in the big, Hollywood type films. But this was really good. It had as much action as some of the films I go to the theatre to see. Now my friend says I should see ""Life is Beautiful."" After hearing about it, I don't think I'm ready for that yet."
12296_0,"This films opening scene takes place with a young girl cheerleader entering the mens locker room which turns out to be a porno film being produced. The story gets very complicated with murder and romance and the web of mystery keeps you spellbound through out the entire picture. Barbara Hershey(Thelma T.K. Knudsen),""Lantana"",'01, is a lawyer who falls in love with a married man and gets deeply involved with his family and finds out that her best friend is married to him. There is a fight and the ice cubes seem to fly all over the place, besides blood in the mens bathroom which becomes a complete mess. There is even a fight in an elevator shaft and Sam Shepard (Detective Beutel),""Blind Horizon,"",'04, comes to Thelma's assistance. Beutel is madly in love with Thelma but suspects her of not telling the truth about what is going on and feels she is becoming a number one suspect. This is a very enjoyable film worth viewing."
12340_0,"The story is about three prisoners and their life in jail captured by a documentary directer Juhi Chawla. As per as acting is concern: Jackie Shroff is average,Nagesh Kukunoor and Gulshan Grover is good,Juhi Chowla is brilliant and above all Naseeruddin Shah is excellent as usual.The script of the film is well written and directed it in a good way. The story comes to end with an unpredictable twist and we can see that how a single incident connects three different peoples for ever just like three walls in a room. The ending doesn't destroys the movie, it makes much more better. I saw almost all the films but this is probably the best movie directed by Nagesh Kukunoor."
12386_0,"This was not the best movie; but it did not have the run of the mill concept in the storyline or the acting. Good job by Ving Rhames, Jim Brown and Terence Howard. I love the message this movie embodies; it sends out an inspiring message to the disillusioned and the ignorant. It's a positive message that can change lives if people learn from the message and apply the wisdom attained. Honestly, I love what Jim said to Ving about the ignorant killing each other, and about being smart instead of tough in the streets. Kudos to the people who worked on this project; there needs to be more movies made with the same or similar practices and ideas. There was a movie named "" Saving God One Soul At A Time "" Ving Rhames stars in this movie also which I've found to have a similar message. If anyone enjoys this movie you will definitely like "" Saving One Soul At A Time "" as well."
12430_0,"The third Dogme film, ""Mifune"" is the best film of the decade. Characters are nicely developed, and pictures are beautifully shot. I can't believe that it is shot without filters and only available light. Nice plot. Kresten's Toshiro Mifune is wonderful. I just want to say ""Thank you for showing this wonderful piece"" 10 of 10"
12476_0,"You know you're in the land of Deep Meaning when the characters are defined instead of named in the credit crawl. I recall the hype surrounding the movie's release. Audiences were yearning for a follow-up to the provocatively themed Easy Rider, something equally thoughtful about America's cultural malaise. But whereas the Fonda film manages to both entertain and reveal, Hellman's manages only a strained seriousness that overworks to the point of tedium. The Road has long been a metaphor for exploring life in America. But here we get a series of clichés about emptiness and alienation surrounding and including the ciphers that are the three main characters, and little else. <br /><br />Now, the film apparently wants to use these existential poses and narrow focus to say something Deep about America or, if not America, at least about something. There are, of course, allusive films that do invite a deeper probing. The trouble here is that Hellman's style is simply too minimalist to reach beyond it's own cramped narrative to a broader social or cultural context that would provide the kind of meaning the movie's apparently reaching for. As a result, the film ends ironically as a kind of character study of three empty characters, and as a Rohrschach test for those intrigued by style over substance. Two Lane may be a cult film to many, especially to the Warren Oates fan club and to those who confuse seriousness with results. But there's a reason Easy Rider still defines the time period, while Two Lane has become grist for a ""What Does It Mean"" study group. It's best to keep in mind that sometimes less really does add up to not enough."

Kristen Bell as Gracie plays a superb role in this movie trying to look after her 1 half sister and 3 half brothers. Eventually she adopts them and becomes their mother. A lesson out there for the parents who are ill treating their children. A must see movie for everyone. I also like the soundtrack of the movie called : I Belong"" by Cherie.... when Gracie was outside racing with the other girls and met his black friend.<br /><br />10 out 10 vote for this movie. Thank you Lifetime for this inspirational movie."
12566_0,"I'm saddened that no one seems to remember Romy Schneider-- at least in the USA they don't. Arguably the most beautiful woman who ever lived, she deserves a place next to Ingrid Bergman, Sophia Loren, Bardot, and Liz, among others, as one of the great screen beauties. This is not her best film and she was a bit past her prime at this point, but anything with Romy is worth seeing. Haunting to watch knowing that she died soon after. The film itself is highly flawed, which is a shame because it had all the right elements-- great director, brilliant cast, fascinating script. What went wrong? Would be interesting to see if someone else can make a successful remake. Perhaps in the hands of Mr. Minghella?... but more likely they'd give it to a Hollywood director who would cast Meg Ryan in the Romy Schneider part. So, let's leave well enough alone. Please."
12610_0,"Comments have complained that this portmanteau film is dated. It would be better to say it registers a crucial political, cultural, and cinematic moment. Marco Bellocchio's short film works best to my thinking. His ""Discutiamo, discutiamo"" (Let's Talk; We're Talking; or maybe Talk and Talk, if you're inclined to be bored) is a dramatic imitation by students of the university movements of the late 1960s, and includes real differences of opinion (it starts with a lecture on Croce's aesthetics; later there's an attempt to set a Croce paperback on fire), and opinions worth remembering once existed. ""La lotta continua"" (class struggle), authoritarian schooling in ruling class values, the small percentage of youths of poor families in university--sure, that's so passé. <br /><br />And for Bertolucci there's Julian Beck as Artaud; for Pasolini, dialectic around the pleasure of Ninetto Davoli. Even Godard's go-gauche, lordly treating every opinion as a quotation, letting all the wind out of what might be concern--or Amore. (See better Bellocchio's ""La Cina è vicina"" for a fashionable leftism.) The Rabbia or righteous wrath of the title is mostly also left to viewers back then or now, and maybe it didn't get rooted."
12656_0,"Larry Fessenden is someone to watch. With first Wendigo and now this, he should be on everyone's cinematic radar- having demonstrated a unique voice, a refusal to do things the way others do them and delivering two absolute masterpieces in a row.<br /><br />Fessenden has a particular eye, a genuinely unnerving sense of pace and an approach to film-making that seems out of it's time. I can't tell if it's the depth of his characters, the measured beats of the screenplay, the great hollows of silence on the soundtrack or the straightforward refusal to write gags into his movies that does it, but it's like he's making movies for smart adults in a genre where such things are rare. And thank god for that, because this world could use some more Larry Fessendens to balance it out.<br /><br />Briefly, Ron Perlman is a hard-bitten Oil Prospector working in the Arctic Tundra. He has to get the big machines in, so that drilling can begin- but the weather's shot to hell and Company-employed Environmentalist Hoffman won't sign the right papers. And something's out there in the wilderness. Something that drives men mad and may have doomed them all.<br /><br />No spoilers here- see it 'cold' (if you'll pardon the pun). If you need it to be categorised, then imagine Kubrick's The Shining, crossed with Carpenter's The Thing, mixed up with Fessenden's own Wendigo sauce. It's a brutal, lyrical screenplay, using some fine actors and glorious cinematography- and it'll creep under your skin. Oh, just see it! Maybe that way, he'll make some more...<br /><br />Steev"
12700_0,"THE PRISONER OF ZENDA premiered September 3rd of 1937 and was produced by David O. Selznick and distributed by United Artists. It is the best of five film versions based on the book by Anthony Hope. Hope was born a poor preachers son who worked his way up to being an unsuccessful lawyer before he failed at writing. But he persisted until his 3rd book PRISONER OF ZENDA and its sequel made him rich and famous. The 1913 film version was made by Edwin S. Porter, director of the 1903 GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. The 1922 version was so successful a sequel was made by producer Lewis Selznick, the father of tonight's film producer David O. Selznick! So David grew up a fan of the book and his father's silent film. In 1933 MGM planned on making a musical version with Nelson Eddy & Jeanette MacDonald. In 1935 MGM thought again they would make a non-musical version but cast THIN MAN stars William Powell and Myrna Loy. But it was super producer Selznick who hit upon the idea in 1937 because of the current media frenzy over the recent coronation of Britain's King Edward VIII who abdicated the thrown to marry a commoner out of true love in 1936! From the opening shot of over thirty trumpeters heralding the start of major work of art producer David O. Selznick wanted to top A TALE OF TWO CITIES made just two years earlier and also starring Ronald Colman, and he does. Ronald Colman was at his peak getting $200,000 for this one film. In the same period he made LOST HORIZON, IF I WERE KING and THE LIGHT THAT FAILED. The cinematography was by a Chinese born American named James Wong Howe. He is considered a legendary master today and there are two completely different shots I want you to look for: the first is halfway through the story when Colman and Carroll arrive at the ball and the camera starts with them being announced and coming through a doorway. That's where I want you to start holding your breath and see if you can hold it until the end of the shot, as they descend the white stairs and the camera slowly pulls back and up and up over 100 feet and reveals the full size of the room. There is some cute comedy relief in the next scene provided by the Orchestra leader who is played by Al Shean who was in real life, uncle to the Marx Brothers. The next shot is later and much more intimate where Raymond Massey and Fairbanks are in a dark room only lit by a fireplace and they sit in two large chairs with their backs to the camera. Our point of view stays behind them and we just watch, as if we were actually in the room ease dropping. Today the scene would be cut into 25 quick edits and unnecessary close-ups. David Niven was just starting out (he's listed just above the cook in the credits) and the director was under utilizing him so Niven improvised some humor and was actually fired until Selznick & director John Cromwell viewed the dailies and decided to let Niven improvise even more thus making him a star. Director John Cromwell was known as a woman's director who mixed lavish, spectacular scenes with warm and tender love scenes and he is the father of current actor James Cromwell who was the understanding farmer in BABE and the corrupt police captain in LA CONFIDENTIAL. Black Michael in case you did not know he is the bad guy and is played with dark vengeance by Raymond Massey. David Niven and Raymond Massey who both starred together in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (1937) and A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (1946) both died on the same day, July 29th 1983. And beautiful Mary Astor of MALTESE FALCON fame is the scheming femme fetal who loves bad men. The stunning blonde beauty Madeline Carroll (she would later say this was her favorite role) was the most successful actress in England at the time. She was so attractive, it is said, Alfred Hitchcock never got over his crush on her while make THE 39 STEPS and forever cast blonds who looked like her as his female leads for the rest of his career. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is the curly haired and handsome henchman with the smile on his lips and danger in his eyes. He originally did not want to take a supporting role but asked his famous father about it. Doug senior (who practically invented swashbucklers) told him he had to do it, PRISONER OF ZENDA was one of the best romances written in a hundred years and always a success and the part of Rupert is probably one of the best villains ever written. He's witty, irresistible and as sly as Iago. Whoever plays Rupert in any stage production in any country, will always be a hit, event though the leading part is a double role. The part is actor-proof, in fact Rin-Tin-Tin could play the part and walk away with it! When the film was first screened for a preview audience it went over only OK and Selznick realized the beginning was too long and since LOST HORIZON another Colman film made that year had it's beginning taken away to speed up the story, that's what he did to PRISONER OF ZENDA, chop off the prologue and epilogue. He also brought in another director W. S. van Dyke to beef up the fencing scenes even more. Douglas and Colman spare with words while mixing with swords in a carefully choreographed fight scene that shows they trained with an Olympic gold winning fencing master! And he then hired Alfred Newman to write a new score and BAM, what an improvement it made!"

In the literature book that I use there is a story called Sealskin, Soulskin, which is an Eskimo story about the selkies and so after we read that story we watch ""The Secret of Roan Inish"". It shows the Irish side of the selkie story. It is a great closing activity for this unit.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to any seventh grade Language Arts teacher who uses the Holt, Reinhart Elements of Literature book. It really goes along with the folktale unit. I hope you can get as much enjoyment from this movie as I and my classes have."
12791_0,"I've heard and read on numerous occasions that ""House"" is an incredibly weird and far-out Japanese interpretation of a haunted house movie, but the truth is that absolutely nothing can fully prepare you for how crazy & demented this film really is. To simply label ""House"" as a horror movie would be a serious insult, as this is more like a fairy-tale on hard drugs, a wacko coming-of-age parable and even somewhat of a musical comedy. Even the often encountered description, saying this film is what ""Beetlejuice"" would look like if directed by Dario Argento, comes to naught. If you really must compare this to any other films, then rank it alongside the weirdest cinematic experiments ever made, like ""El Topo"", ""I Walk like a Crazy Horse"" and ""Possession"". I think you can philosophy about the deeper meanings and symbolism of ""Hausu"" for weeks, and every opinion and interpretation could be assumed as correct. Me, personally, I regard the plot as a sort of version of ""Hansel and Gretel"", but with seven Japanese Gretels and no Hansel and with an auntie in a remote creepy castle instead of a witch in a gingerbread cabin in the woods. Summer vacation is coming up, but the holiday plans of the cute teen Oshare abruptly become canceled when his father introduces his new and much younger girlfriend. Instead of traveling with them, Oshare invites her six closest school friends  all of them with adorable nicknames based on their personalities, like Fantasy, Kung-Fu and Melody  to head out to the countryside and pay a visit to Oshare's aunt whom she hasn't seen since her mother died. The aunt's welcoming is extremely warm and gracious, but she as well as her estate and even the white cat Snowflake are nevertheless surrounded with an aura of mystery and creepiness. Agatha Christie style, the girls then subsequently meet their highly imaginative deaths one by one. The girl who's always hungry, for example, has her head replaced by a watermelon and the musical chick literally becomes consumed by the piano. ""House"" is filled with optical illusion special effects that are not exactly terrifying but nevertheless very deadly to the main characters. Even though director Nobuhiko Obayashi maintains the ambiance of a fantasy/fairy-tale movie, the imagery he uses is often bizarrely nightmarish and grim, with decapitated heads in wells and tap-dancing skeletons and whatnot. The girls' characters are beautifully drawn, and hence you feel a lot of sympathy for each and every single one of them, and it's a very stylish film altogether. Especially for being a late 70's movie  when the horror movies were at their most explicitly rancid and exploitative  ""Hausu"" is an artistic and elegant accomplishment and it honestly deserves to be wider known, globally acclaimed and more discussed."
12836_0,"Just a couple of things I thought were worth mentioning after reading the other comments. First of all, you have to remember that Kusanagi is a cyborg. Throughout the movies you as the viewer are constantly reminded that she feels a certain detachment from her body. She also takes getting shot up rather lightly. So with this in mind, I prefer to think of her body is more like clothing to her. It's not her real body after all. You almost don't notice how skimpy her wardrobe is if u can see it from this perspective. <br /><br />Secondly the movies do give u a much better understanding of the characters and scenario and are worth checking out before you watch the series. Just keep in mind that the movies and series are two directors different takes on the Manga by Masamune Shirow. <br /><br />Both the movies and series are beautifully constructed but as this is the comment area for Stand alone Complex that's what I'll rate. <br /><br />(by the way; bare with the 2nd gig. Closter towards the end it will have you nailed to the screen)"
12881_0,"This is the first of the three Gilbert and Sullivan operettas produced by the Australian Essgee company. It is not as bad The Mikado and HMS Pinafore. Presumably there was a learning curve before the company attained its peak of vulgarity. Some of the elements are already in place: there is, for instance, the orchestra consisting of three synthesizers, two percussion and bass. This ensures that, whatever the singers may do, the production can have no musical merit whatsoever. The women's chorus consists of three harridans who call themselves ""The Fabulous Singlettes"" who give a bloodcurdling rendition of ""Climbing over rocky mountains"". Jon English, as the Pirate King is truly repulsive. I have noticed in these productions that he tends to step out of character and address the audience with comments such as: ""Colour and movement, that's what you need when the plot is sagging a bit"". The implication is that he may have been attending a Drama 101 course during the making of this series.<br /><br />Derek Metzger has the makings of a good Major General. He can handle the patter but is more concerned with stage business. During ""I am the very model of a modern Major General"" he conjures a bouquet of flowers from his anus and hands them to one of the Fatuous Singlettes with the remark: ""Put those in some water and then wash your hands"". Tim Tyler as the police sergeant spits ping pong balls while singing ""When the foeman bares his steel"", a performance that perhaps would be more fitting in a shady Bangkok nightclub. Helen Donaldson as Mabel really can sing, she has an excellent high register and easily accomplishes the coloratura pyrotechnics of the bel canto pastiche: ""Poor wand'ring one"". Sadly, it is to little avail with the pounding percussion and the Crapulous Singlettes bumping and grinding behind her.<br /><br />Director Peter Butler has an uncanny knack of positioning his camera at the wrong place at the wrong time. Incredibly, this is the man who once directed Joan Sutherland in ""Lucia di Lammermoor"". I can just imagine the scene with La Stupenda saying ""I know this is the mad scene Peter darling, but not the ping pong balls, please"". The performance was filmed live in Queensland in 1994 and, I must say, the Queensland audience appears to love every minute. I suppose if I were watching my local amateur dramatic company performing in the village hall I would be more indulgent but there is really no reason why this amateurish production should be showing in the opera slot of the flagship, high definition Artsworld channel in 2006"
12926_0,"This moody version of Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Gothic novel is quite simply one of the most accomplished British films of the 1940's.<br /><br />With cinematography reminiscent of (and rivaling)that seen in David Lean's ""Great Expectations,"" it is a pity that this picture is not better known.<br /><br />This may accrue from the fact that an American, heavily edited, and re-titled version (""The Inheritance"") is the only print in U.S. circulation.<br /><br />At all costs avoid this butcher job, as the 6 minutes of missing footage are very germane to the story's narrative, mood and imagery.<br /><br />Jean Simmons is a reminder of yet another lost dramatic staple--a decorous, demure heroine, who speaks in complete sentences with flawless diction. Her lady like deportment combined with her unquestioned loveliness makes her a very sympathetic Lady Caroline. Mr. De Marney is similarly impressive as the sinister, titular character. <br /><br />But the film belongs to Katina Paxinou as the redoubtable Madame De La Rougierre. I believe Mr. Le Fanu would approve of her performance. In any case, her first appearance, as depicted with her malignant face peering through a rain lashed window pane, is as startling an entrance as one could hope for.<br /><br />Laurence Irving's art direction is superb, (and some of his sketches for this film are included in Edward Carrick's ""Art and Design in the British Film,"" Dennis Dobson, London) fully realizing, as it does, the stories' atmospheric requirements, and amply demonstrating how superior sound stages are to location shooting.<br /><br />All told, this picture stands favorably alongside Thorold Dickinson's ""Queen of Spades,"" Terence Young's ""Corridor of Mirrors,"" Anthony Pelissier's ""Rocking Horse Winner,"" Leslie Arliss' ""Night Has Eyes,"" Jacques Tourneur's ""Experiment Perilous,"" and Martin Gabel's ""The Lost Moment,"" as one of a small group of visually distinguished Gothic melodramas of the 1940's, and far superior to the more recent television version, which despite the welcome presence of Peter O'Toole and Barbara Shelley lacks both flavor and mood."
12971_0,"I would've figured this to be just another lame joked Bachelor Party movie. Well it was pretty lame when it tried to be funny, but it actually had an excellent story if you can believe it. I wouldn't technically call this a comedy movie, because it didn't make me laugh at all. But this is a pretty decent adventure movie with a fantastic story to it. You may feel let down because the movie did pretty horrible, but if you watch the entire movie and follow the story you will find it to be a little better than the story of comedies that have made it big at the box office. I thought the movie was a little overboard with trying to be funny and all, but once again the story and plot is the only thing that can save it.<br /><br />4/10"

Segal's film is also visually striking, especially the wide empty streets of L.A. but unfortunately the feature has some incredibly campy moments at rather tense sequences. Heston is very good at his role here. Which it is one of the reasons why ""The Omega Man"" remain memorable for over the years. Although this is the second version of ""I Am Legend"", Based on a novel by Richard Matheson (Duel, A Stir of Echoes, What Dreams May Come). First version was done in the 1960's titled ""The Last Man on Earth"" starring Vincent Price and last year's ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith. Which these three films has the same premise but done completely different. The book also inspired filmmaker George A.

Irene even breaks up a marriage between June Forsyte, (Janet Leigh) who was going to marry Philip Bosinney.

No real hint is given what this may have been, either terrestrial or not.<br /><br />The most fascinating thing I've found is how it is still bouncing around in my mind.

13240_0,"This Franco-Italian ""Eastern Western"" has intrigued me since I read about it on a magazine, in view of its then-upcoming showing on Italian TV, when I was about 7 years old  but it literally seemed to vanish from the face of the earth in the interim! Given that fact and Leonard Maltin's unpromising ** rating, I had suspected that it was going to be a big disappointment when I eventually catch up with it  but, happily, it turned out not to be the case. It is actually a very enjoyable large-scale action film which, while perhaps lacking the touch of greatness, deserves to be re-evaluated more positively.<br /><br />The four international leads  Charles Bronson, Toshiro Mifune, Alain Delon, Ursula Andress  are top-notch and the supporting cast also includes Capucine, Anthony Dawson and Luc (here billed as Luke) Merenda. The chemistry between betrayed outlaw Bronson and samurai warrior Mifune is especially successful and provides the film with some nice humorous touches (as well as a couple of good lines); their casting is all the more interesting for its pairing one of THE SEVEN SAMURAI (1954) with a member of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960), that film's equally popular Americanization! Delon has a smaller part than I was expecting but he does well as Bronson's double-crossing partner-in-crime who, apart from the pre-requisite European sophistication, has a vicious streak about him. Andress adds the required eye-candy as his sluttish girlfriend and, along with Monica Randall (playing Mifune's inexperienced one night stand at Capucine's rundown brothel), provides the film with some unexpected  if very welcome  dashes of nudity.<br /><br />Besides, there's a fine if subdued score from Maurice Jarre; as befits the film's title, too, renowned cinematographer Henri Alekan often bathes the scenery in a warm golden hue and the use of remote locations throughout is inspired. Still, the film could probably do with a few trims here and there, as some scenes tend to go on too long  such as the afore-mentioned mid-section revolving around Bronson and Mifune, and the climactic Indian attack. The full-frame presentation is not too bad considering: I can only complain of excessive headroom on occasion and a general washed-out look to the print on the U.K. disc I watched."

The source of his consternation seems to be a group of aristocrats, including Kitano Takeshi and Matsuda Ryuhei who plays the leader, who rule society from the shadows. Fighting the vengeful souls of samurai he killed in the past, a pistol wielding old man with a voice box, a prostitute, a huge black man in the robes of a Buddhist monk, Bob ""The Beast"" Sapp,"" makes his way closer to his goal, but as his bad karma accumulates Izo loses his remaining humanity and quickly morphs into a demon.<br /><br />Yet, who or what is Izo? Supposedly in order for there to be perfection, all the imperfections of the world must be shed of like a second skin and dissipate into nothingness. However, Izo becomes the personification of this nothingness, a being created entirely of bad karma trapped in a Möbius strip in which time and space are both very fragile where he suffers the torment he brought to others.<br /><br />Some film viewers seem to think that Izo is an overwrought mess with pedantic aspirations that fail miserably. Some think it achieves its goals while many just enjoy the film's high gore factor. I did not know what to think at first. I quickly grew bored at the beginning of the film when it seemed as if it was going to be nothing more than one blood bath after the other, although I did think some of Izo's enemies were quite creative. However, as the film progressed I became a bit more interested in some underlying themes of the film: man made constructions of love, nation, etc. To me one of the most interesting aspects of the film was the ""bard,"" a middle-aged man with a guitar. As those who have read the Tale of Heike know the oral story of how the Heike, Taira fell to the Genji, Minamoto, clan was told by normally blind biwa playing monks in order to appease the souls of the Heike samurai so they would not return as vengeful spirits. While this ""bard"" might not be serving this same purpose, the songs he sings are quite chilling and the visuals, such as the girls marching while wearing gasmasks, are quite stunning. Is Izo a good film? That is hard to say, but I believe that it offers different conclusions for different viewers. If one is looking for a confusing bloodbath, you'll find it here. If one is looking for deeper philosophical questions in a miasma of blood and guts, you'll find it here as well, or at least it could aid you in finding these questions within your own being."

13376_0,"I loved this movie more because I was able to relate to the people and places it represents. I'm not a technical critic and this is not a technical review. My favourite films touch an emotional chord and this is one of them. It was a very personal film to me. I served with Tongans as a missionary myself, but in the more Westernized society of Australia. I just want to say that I had to chuckle at a few comments. There is as much variance in reaction to this film as there is to the story of Joseph Smith (the 'founder' of the LDS faith) himself. It interests me that some people see this as a propaganda piece and also as a statement of the perceived supremacy of the ""white man's religion"". The Tongans who I met loved their religion (as the Tongans did in this movie). To them it was as personal as it is to me, and to the German, Australian, Samoan, Chilean and Phillipino Mormons I have met. Was the preaching of LDS Missionaries to my parents in England a white supremist act? Of course not, no more than it was to the Tongans or any other nationality or culture. Tongans serve today as missionaries, of their own free will, as enthusiastic and committed as Groberg was then. The message to me from this, is that there is a level of humanity that transcends the temporary diversity of culture. Groberg and his beloved friends found that place in ""The Other Side of Heaven"". Something so very personal that it is very hard to express on film. I think this movie was as honest as it could possibly be. It was the experience and perspective of Groberg as he recorded it. It was true to his literature, upon which it was based. To question its integrity is to question the integrity of Groberg himself, the people he interacted with in Tonga and the motive of the film-makers who tried to translate his memoirs to film. You have a right to question them. If you find this film offensive, preachy, lacking in artistic expression or drama or just sickly-sweet, I feel sorry for you. To me this motion picture experience is an expression of real-life at its fullest. A wonderful achievement."
13420_0,"Splash is the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Perhaps it even started the entire genre!<br /><br />I thought the story was excellent and John Candy was awsome (too bad he died). Tom Hanks was fine and the girl was ok (anyone could have done here part but it was ok. no biggie). <br /><br />I did think that this script should have been given to a better director which I thought did a mediocre job. Ron Howard -puke! did you see The Grinch -OH! How Awfully boring!! I would like to see A Beautiful Mind but I found out he did it and so therefore it will probably stink.<br /><br />Anyhow, this plays out like a fairy tale and one to remember, a keeper to buy on videotape and play for the kids or yourself.<br /><br />Even though I thought it should have been way way way better, I will give it a 10/10."
13466_0,"Who would have thought an 8-minute cartoon could produce such emotions? At first I was sad and really felt the depression when sweet little Porky's heart is broken. Porky takes some drastic measures, and ends up dreaming about his life with the girl he wants to marry, but doesn't want to marry him. It is funny, and then heartbreaking if anyone's life would turn out like his dream. Porky then wakes up to decide whether he still wants his dream girl. I truly felt sad for Porky and understood his decisions. I was angry at the girl, Petunia Pig, for she was only using Porky and breaking his fragile heart. The cartoon, in only 8 minutes, makes the viewer think about his/her own life and suggests that you think about big decisions in your life before making them. Perhaps the sweetest moment in cartoon/film history is when Porky goes to see his dream girl and she laughs at him. He walks off her front porch only to first turn around and kiss a plate with her name written on it that is displayed by her front door. Porky then walks off heartbroken. What a greatly sad moment."
13510_0,"I saw this film many years ago, and still think of it as one of the finest movies ever. The reason I came today to comment it is that while reviewing the comments about another film I saw yesterday, I find that that that one was among the 50 best films in IMDB. While that move was good, I could not see how this one is not even among the 250 best.<br /><br />If you are a father of children who moved away, or if you are a child who moved away from your birthplace, you will appreciate this movie. It applies to Italian immigrants, or to African immigrants in Italy (there is a scene showing them sleeping in cardboard boxes that shows how human is that experience of being alone in a foreign place). you do not even have to leave your country, as this movie shows, to find yourself trying to make it alone, and trying to make your parents believe that you are OK. Of course, like in every good lie, some help from the person being lied is also needed.<br /><br />If you can rent it, or if you hear of this movie being shown on your local station, please see it. It will be one of the best movies you will se in your life. It is a 10/10 for me."
13556_0,"***SPOILERS, IF I CAN REMEMBER THEM***<br /><br />A college roommate introduced me to this unforgettable little film, based on my love for laughably bad movies, and it did not disappoint. Purely a vehicle for slasher T&A, the movie makes no excuses and doesn't really take it itself all that seriously - what movie COULD, after having a man fall off a 15-story building and walk away?<br /><br />To me, the shower scenes were just a softcore running gag, but I suppose some people could be turned-on, by them. It's just funny, for me, thinking about the writers' meeting that must have taken place ('Okay, the story's finished. Now, how do we get all of them into the shower?').<br /><br />The highlight of the film, for me, was the irrepressible Orville coming back from one death after another, and not seeming to hold all the abuses against anyone, when it's over. Favorite scene: Orville pulls the mail spindle he has been stabbed with out of his heart, and uses a stapler to attach a bandage to his chest.<br /><br />Worth the 99-cent rental fee."
13600_0,"Once upon a time, three little girls went to the police academy. and they were each assigned very hazardous duties, but I took them all away from all that and now they work for me. My name is Charlie. Those famous words started the all time greatest TV show in history Charlie's Angels. When the pilot aired in March of 1976, it starred Farrah Fawcett Majors as Jill who was the athletic angel, Jaclyn Smith as Kelly who was the streetwise angel, Kate Jackson as Sabrina who was the cool smart, multilingual leader, David Doyle as John Bosley, David Ogden Stiers as Scott Woodville and John Forsythe as the voice of Charlie. Kate Jackson was aboard from the beginning of the project, and was set to play the lead angel. Farrah Fawcett was the next to join; filling the blonde role, but then the producers dropped the hair color concept and brought in Jaclyn Smith to complete the trio. Many of the scenes used in the opening credits of the show are from this pilot episode. Then in the fall of September of 1976 ABC introduce the three stunning, sexy and young former police officers, private detectives working for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency with the entire crew back except David Ogden Stiers. In the opening sequence of the first season no one knew where the Angels went to the police academy. The wealthy Charlie Townsend, their never-seen boss, relayed assignments via a speaker telephone. The Angels worked with their trusty male counter-part, John Bosley. After only 23 episodes, Farrah left the show at the end of the first season. When Farrah Fawcett left the series, her absence was explained by having her character Jill become a professional racing driver on the NASCAR circuit. Along with a new Angel, the show received a new time slot. The Angels remained on Wednesday nights, but moved from 10pm to 9pm. This change in time opened up a whole world of new viewers who wanted to know what the big fuss was all about and kept the ""Angels"" right where they belong - on top of the ratings! The 1977-1978 season ended with high ratings, proved that Kris, Cheryl Ladd, was every bit as popular with the viewers as Farrah. In the 1979-1980 season, the answer came with Shelley Hack, a model who had been prominent in Revlon's ""Charlie"" Perfume ads and commercials. Shelley entered The Townsend Office as Tiffany Welles, an Ivy League scholar who also was a graduate from the Boston Police Academy. Spelling and Goldberg had the idea that with this new Angel/model at the helm, she could bring an elegant and classy touch to Charlie's trio! Kate Jackson's absence was explained by having Sabrina getting married and starting a family. The writers treaded lightly as they tried to figure out how to make Tiffany Welles the new ""Sabrina Duncan"". The 1979-1980 seasons' problem was the sudden decline in ratings. The series found itself in the top 20's instead of the top 10 were it had been for the last three years. The ratings drop was directed at the new Angel and at the end of the season, Shelley was let go of her detective duties. Thus, beginning, for another hunt for a new Angel! By 1980, Charlie's Angels was beginning to feel its age and was declining fast. Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg wanted to go with a fresh new image. After careful consideration, they decided to hire virtually unknown actress, Tanya Roberts. This time around, the character would be a model-turned-detective, street-smart Julie Rogers. The new Angel showed her face in the three-hour 1980-1981 season premiere on November 30, 1980. High hopes were placed on Charlie's newest Angel to pull the series out its failing ratings. To help give it an added boost, the Angels were sent to Hawaii for the first six episodes. Hawaii wasn't only chosen to intrigue the audience but to keep the Angels scantily clad in swimsuits! Charlie's opening monologue has now undergone a complete overhaul. It begins, ""Once upon a time, there were three beautiful girls. Two of them graduated from the police academy. The other graduated from a top school for models. And they each reaped the rewards of their exciting careers Bosley looks over brochures of Hawaii in anticipation of the Angels' possible assignment there. Charlie arranges for Julie to receive a probationary investigator's license and begin working with Kris and Kelly. Unfortunately, at this point, the audience was no longer keeping up with the Angels antics. In February 1981, the show went on hiatus and wasn't shown again until June of 1981. Charlie's Angels was not winning any viewers in the summer of '81 with its remaining episodes. The show that had made women crime fighters popular during the 1970's was taken off the air. Charlie's Angels was a huge success the moment it hit the airwaves in 1976. The Angels were on gum cards, doll boxes, T-shirts, board games, puzzles and posters. If you wanted to hire the Angels you had to call the office phone number was 555-0267. Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith) was the only Angel to last the entire series. Kelly was an orphan. John Forsythe' was never on the set - his voice was recorded, and dubbed in later. The Angels all drove Ford automobiles. Jill (and later Kris) drove a Cobra, Kelly drove a Mustang, and Sabrina drove a Pinto. For the record, Bosley drove a Ford L.T.D. Although Charlie was never heard, he did actually appear in a couple of episodes, but his face was never shown. Kelly is the only Angel to have been shot throughout the run of the show. Sabrina was the only Angel that was previously married. She was married to a fellow officer when she was still a cop but the marriage ended in divorce."
13646_0,"Good Morning, Miss Dove is a property that I'm surprised Frank Capra didn't think to direct. It's entirely possible that Capra was a male chauvinist who only thought in terms of men who sacrifice like George Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. In many ways Jennifer Jones is the superior of Capra's George Bailey.<br /><br />Jennifer's crisis comes real early in the beginning, she's the daughter of a well bred and prominent family whose father has just died. She thinks she's come into it, but she finds she's inherited debts beyond belief because dad was borrowing and living well beyond his means. To keep his good name, she gives up the life she expected like George Bailey and in the process becomes the moral center of her small town.<br /><br />Her road was much harder than Jimmy Stewart's because Miss Dove never married, she instead devoted her life to teaching history and geography and never getting to see the faraway places with strange sounding names that she only read about. That song could have been written for her. George Bailey did have Mary Bailey and the kids, that was denied to Miss Dove.<br /><br />That's just one of the flashbacks in a film that has many. In fact the current story is the fact this rock of the community is undergoing a health crisis and is admitted to the hospital. As she deals with her health issues and the many people who wish her well, her mind reflects on just how much influence she's had on generations of kids passing through her class.<br /><br />She's a severe woman Ms. Dove, having denied herself a personal life. But she's also a kind and caring one and that comes through with all the people we see her interact with.<br /><br />Despite a fine cast of players, Jennifer Jones dominates this film in a fine portrayal of what is essentially an unglamorous part. It's the kind of role you might see someone like Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn do, but Jones is just fine in it.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of Jennifer Jones, you will be after seeing Good Morning, Miss Dove."
13691_0,"This movie is almost perfect, if there is such a thing. Meryl Streep gives her finest performance ever as Sophie. In fact, her performance here is quite possibly the best movie acting that I have ever seen. (It's really that good.) Plus there's even more--the music, the directing, the writing, the supporting actors--are all excellent. Be warned that this movie is very moving and tragic, but it is extremely well done. It will make you cry and laugh--it will fill you with hope and despair--it will make you appreciate life and understand sorrow."
13736_0,"This movie has no physical violence, but it's truly scary. Chad is evil. He hurts others' feelings for the pleasure of showing himself that he can. He has an explanation for his cruelty, but that's just to draw Howard in to play his game. Without that explanation, he'd still find reasons to be cruel, because his pleasure comes from seeing others in pain. Worse, he can get away with his cruelty, because he is charming, charismatic, and effectively manipulative in his dealings with people. Except in the central plot, he manages to hurt people without taking the blame, by making his victims blame themselves.<br /><br />Howard is both a victim and a willing participant in Chad's evil plot. Without people like him, people like Chad are much less able to hurt others. But people who are too weak to stand in the way of bad people are fairly common. Even those weak enough to be drawn into the plots of bad people are common enough. Even a person strong enough to foil Chad's plot could only have done so if he had known about it, and Chad knew not to trust his plans with such a person. Howard had a chance to be the hero, but he was too weak and became another villain.<br /><br />The central victim, Christine, started out suspicious, but was drawn in by Chad's skillful manipulation, and to some extent Howard's real interest in her. Chad was also good at choosing a victim who would fall for the plot, just as he chose an accomplice effectively. Other victims had other weaknesses that Chad found ways of exploiting, like the man whose speech he mocked in a way that made that victim feel like he himself was to blame.<br /><br />Most people have never met a serial killer, but many have met people like Chad, who enjoy hurting others. The fact that Chad is an example of a more familiar type of evil makes him much scarier. He's more chilling because he doesn't have a clear reason for his badness -- he just enjoys being cruel. What is scarier than an evil that one can imagine falling victim to in everyday life?"
13781_0,"Being from Rhode Island and working on Federal Hill, I feel that this movie truly captured the essence of the Italian American young adult in it's day and age. Believe me, the characters are soooooo close to home.. Corrente really was able to portray the ""spacone"" better than a lot of other directors were able to do.. Definitely watch this movie.... and if your from Rhode Island and haven't seen it yet.... rent it.. buy it.. watch it.. get some haven brothers and watch it.... I had a lot of laughs watching these guys run around the state to places that I can relate to... everything from food spots to night clubs.. I love the scene when Nicky cooks for his girlfriend.. really funny.. it reminds me of myself.."
13826_0,"I just noticed that ""Melvin and Howard"" registered a mere 6.6 on the IMDb rating scale. Don't you believe it! This is a great American movie. Director Demme and writer Goldman take a footnote to history -- a contested Howard Hughes will that named Melvin Dummar, a milkman who once loaned him a quarter, as one of his heirs -- and turn that slight material into a wry meditation on the American Dream. Or more specifically, the thin line that separates the American Dream from pure hell. Demme has a great eye for people like Dummar, a dreamer whose clock for realizing his dreams is winding down. The performances are terrific, especially Paul Le Mat as Dummar (whatever happened to Le Mat?) and Mary Steenburgen who won an Oscar for playing his wife. Jason Robards does one of his patented cameos playing a real life character (his Howard Hughes makes a neat hat trick with his Oscar winning performances as Dashiell Hammett and Ben Bradley.) Watch for the real-life Melvin Dummar as the counterman in the bus station where Steenburgen makes a sandwich for her daughter. This is a small but knowing and winning movie. It definitely gets my vote for ""Milkman of the Month""!"
13871_0,"Inane, ridiculous, boring, stupid, hilariously bad. This movie is all these things and more. ""Leonard: Part 6"" was Oscar-worthy compared to this. I feel fairly confident that I could have come up with a better movie by having no script at all and just telling the actors to improvise their lines. At least Bette Davis had the sense to realize how beneath her this movie was. The thing is, this movie is beneath the acting skills of most of the people in it. Including the cat."
13916_0,"The animation was the good part, and the ONLY good part. See, Disney has lost its charm by this point (it's lost it for years--at least since the 70's, when the films became more savvy than charming) and they were trying to necromance a charming movie. But you can't slap savvy on top of charming. It just doesn't work. Instead of the atmospheric silence of the original film, we have hideous pop songs slapped in when the characters aren't yapping. Thumper's siblings are inexplicably turned into very annoying little sisters (Hint to Disney writers: Having screechy characters yell out ""big bwother!"" isn't cute). Faline and Bambi are suddenly in looooove with each other, ignoring the fact that they'd still be in the cootie phase at that point in time if you paid any attention to the original film.<br /><br />In other words, fine, Disney can be savvy or hip, whatever. Just don't try to wreck a charming classic with it. Make a whole new film with new characters and release your animators on that. They deserve better."
13961_0,"Not badly acted, but it almost seems like you had moments where there were three different movies going on here, and they inadvertently intersected.<br /><br />Essentially, an evil Real Estate woman unearths a bog body and orders it dumped instead of reporting it to the authorities. Well, when the Bog Body comes back to life by being put in water (are they like ""Sea Monkeys""?) it starts wandering around modern Ireland looking for people (and yappy dogs) to kill. Meanwhile, our six main characters gather at the house of a ""hunter"".<br /><br />We find out all the main characters killed someone and dumped them in the bog. So the Bog was finding revenge. Maybe. Don't know, because half of them are killed by accidents, while the Bog Man is killing innocent bystanders in the nearby town.<br /><br />The thing is a truly convoluted mess, and I'm not even sure what the point is..."
14005_0,"For the art house crowd comes this critically panned film never released theatrically in the U.S. `Nadja' director Michael Almareyda comes up with his skewed version of The Mummy, complete with hip characters, fun surprises, a great alternate music soundtrack, Christopher Walken doing a Irish accent but otherwise being his quirky old self, brilliant cinematography from Jim Denault and a flair for the unexpected.<br /><br />The perfectly enjoyable heroes are Allison Elliott and Jared Harris, as a cheerfully drunken couple going to Ireland to dry out. The movie acknowledges the ""alcoholic"" problem by having them not deal with it or call attention to it, and it's to the movie's credit that it's never an ""issue"" or makes them into completely awful or unbelievably irresponsible parents (they're just normally irresponsible, like most parents.)<br /><br />* * * for The Eternal, an imperfect gem."
14050_0,"I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10.<br /><br />I found it highly interesting to finally get to see this famous black and white film made in 1931, starring James Cagney.<br /><br />Jean Harlow also puts in a too brief appearance, and is mostly window dressing. She wears some gorgeous gowns and other outfits, and looked quite radiant on screen.<br /><br />While the film is dated, as to be expected: with language, the way the actors/actresses deliver their lines, the child-like behavior of the main character's mother, and with other women portrayed as either good girls or tarts--merely there to help and serve their men--the film is nevertheless entertaining and definitely held my interest throughout.<br /><br />The film begins with the main character, Tommy Powers (played by Cagney) and his pal, Matt Doyle (played by Edward Woods)as young boys, possibly twelve or so, already getting into trouble on the city streets and making the acquaintance of shady characters.<br /><br />The story progresses to the era of prohibition and bootlegging with Tom and Matt becoming gangsters and showing what kind of lives they lead, and where their actions eventually take them."
14096_0,"While the original Italian title – THE POLICE ASKS FOR HELP – clearly pigeonholes this one in the then-popular (and incredibly prolific) poliziottesco genre, the English title under which it is better known around the world – WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOUR DAUGHTERS? – implies a giallo in the same vein as Dallamano’s best-known film, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO SOLANGE? (1972). In any case, while both elements are effectively present – a hatchet-wielding murderer is the subject of the climactic manhunt – the police procedural themes are more prevalent.<br /><br />The film deals with a teenage suicide which eventually uncovers a child prostitution ring which, as usual, includes not just the petty sleazy oddballs (here personified by Franco Fabrizi) but also high-profile professionals (a celebrated doctor) and high-ranking government officials (a Minister). The cast is surprisingly good for this type of genre effort: Claudio Cassinelli (as the investigating Police Chief), Giovanna Ralli (unusually cast as a female D.A.), Mario Adorf as the policeman who finds the first body and also discovers that his own teenage daughter was once a “victim” of these perverts, the afore-mentioned Fabrizi and Hollywood veteran Farley Granger in a smallish role as the first victim’s father.<br /><br />As usual for Italian genre movies, the music score is an asset and here it is provided by Stelvio Cipriani whose motif, while simple and repetitive, is extremely effective given that it involves children singing gibberish (and thus commenting on the main theme of the movie itself even through its performers). Alarmingly, the end titles claim that every year in Italy, 8000 teenagers run away from home but only a small percentage returns to the fold – the majority are never found!"
14140_0,"I have not seen this movie in 30 years, but I remember every scene as if it were yesterday, and the deep feelings that I had when I first saw it lingers on as well. THOSE are the marks of a truly memorable film.<br /><br />If a film like this were made today, even including a contemporary problem to replace the Cold War theme, it would go over the heads of a majority of the audience. Why? Because the movie-going public wants blow-em-up action to go along with any plot. Except for the cities that the twin terrors Colossus-Guardian nuke (almost off camera), this has none. Secondly, this is a thinking-person's movie that goes beyond the typical ""Machines take over the world"" theme that we've seen in the Terminator series and the Matrix series.<br /><br />What makes this move work on so many levels is that it taps into our greatest fears -- one of which is NOT death, but the loss of control over our lives. Why are people afraid to fly when their chances of being killed in an auto crash are so many times greater? Loss of control.<br /><br />These supercomputers were designed to act in the place of humans by making human-like decisions such as ""Kill or be killed"" and ""Offense makes the best defense."" Unlike other machines vs. humans, in this movie, the computers do not fear humans, or even dislike them. Even when they kill a few million, it is done without malice. It is pure logic, and that is what is also scary -- making decisions without regard to the value of a single, human life. To the computer, deaths are just statistics, and in the ""Mutually-Assured-Destruction"" mentality of the Cold War, the side who has the last man standing is declared the winner.<br /><br />Also, unlike contemporary movies, these two, big computing hulks do not become ""self-aware"" in any human sense. Nor do they go beyond the level of their individual programming. They are making decisions that they have been taught will make for a better world.<br /><br />There are no, ""Forbin as father and Colossus as son"" overtones here like those in ""I-Robot."" If anything, Colossus becomes the authoritarian father-figure -- as in ""I know what is best for you"" -- perhaps mirroring Forbin's real father. This authoritarian father complex is what drives the computer's decisions.<br /><br />It does not take a great leap of consciousness for Colossus/Guardian to know that threats alone do not work with children. There has to be logical consequences for their misbehavior also -- which are horrible to even think about in the human mind, but in the computer mind, it is ""Necessary"" for the good of all concerned.<br /><br />How many human leaders/despots have followed that logic? Too many to count."
14186_0,"I believe this movie is graced by O'Toole's and Sharif' best performances ever - very different from their roles in Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. Even though it is extremely long (134 minutes), still you never notice the time passing. There are no epic scenes or battle scenes - mainly it is two to three people talking leisurely in each scene... still it somehow has some kind of magic that keeps your attention all the time. The main theme of the hunt for the prostitute murderer is intertwined with the terrible final days of the Reich, culminated together at the same time. Definitely a milestone in movie history. All the actors and actresses are fine, and the story is just amazing. 10/10"
14230_0,"I am Russian and I just checked this movie out because i heard so much about it. I find this movie OK. It's not a masterpiece. But it's much better than the other Russian blockbuster Night Watch. However, both of these films have something bad in common and it's the immature obsession of excessive cheesy visual effects. When watching these high budget movies you start thinking the filmmakers forget that it's not the visual effects that make movie a good movie. Those parts in the movie, where they show the dark abyss all the time and then this LOTR style map pops up with a wheel falling down - it just doesn't look good, it looks totally tasteless. I mean the producers spent so much resources to make all those costumes and setups, but when you see something like this, it just ruins the whole point. Bad bad taste. Hopefully, in future Russian filmmakers will grow out this unhealthy obsession and start making great and stylish movies."
14276_0,"This is one of those movies that keep you watching despite a sloppy screenplay - why, for God's sake, does Korvo (Jose Ferrer) first attempt to gain control of Ann Sutton's (Gener Tierney) mind in the middle of a cocktail party albeit in an empty room into which anyone could have wandered and why, when Tierney discovers the body of Ferrer's ex lover, do two guys turn up from nowhere and call the police. Add to this Richard Conte as arguably the most unconvincing psychiatrist in screen history and we begin to see the size of the problem. Nevertheless Tierney keeps us watching as Ferrer is effective as the quack Korvo."
14320_0,"How can they be in the film if they are extinct?<br /><br />That is what a kid said, seeing dinosaur. The special effects were extraordinary. The fur of the monkey was moving with the wind. The integration of real life image with computer generated ones was perfect.<br /><br />The story was simple, perfect for the 6 or 7 year old. For younger kids, It depends on their sensibility. Some kids were had to stop watching the movie and turn around because they were afraid! It's not that the movie is too violent. (There is violence, but those are dinosaur!!!!) It is the way they show the ""Carnosaurs"" and the ""Velociraptors"" that is scary, in combination with the music. Also, younger kids may have trouble to focus their interest on the movie because there is a lot of dialogue. My daughter that is used to see movies and usually watch them could stop moving the whole representation.<br /><br />So it's a good child movie for 6 year old and older. Younger kid may be afraid or may lose interest. And for the adult? It's a cute movie, perfect for a first date.<br /><br />"
14366_0,"This movie is about an irresponsible young couple that live in their car with no means of support. When they find out they are expecting, they see their unborn baby as a way to make money. They research many couples on the internet (how do you have internet with no place to live?) and visit a prospective couple. A couple they have seemingly chosen as the adoptive parents. The couples come together and things go well as long as the baby's biological father can keep his true nature under control. He gets angry and slaps his pregnant girlfriend which makes the adoptive father question whether or not they are making the right choice with this adoption. It is from this point that things start beginning to take twists and turns. You may be able to predict how the movie is going to end, but the trip to the end is an enjoyable one."
14410_0,"This is my first Cassavetes film (as a director) and I red all the reviews warning people not to start with this one, but I must say that I'm quite satisfied that I did. This is truly a unique piece of film making and a nice character study showed through, what appears to be a special 70's crime movie style. I love American genre films of the 70's so that is mainly why I started with this one, and it scored.<br /><br />I think that Cassavetes explored depths that were unexplored in American cinema of that time, and it perfectly shows in this film, how you can make an art/crime picture. I watched truncated 104 minutes, version, but id doesn't appear to be missing anything, either in plot or character development.Definitely recommended even if you're not a fan of John Cassavetes's style."
14456_0,"After seeing all the reviews, I must say that my opinion is mixed. On the one hand, the plot and concept of the movie are very interesting and surprising. On the other hand, the form and style of this movie are blurry and slow/repetitive at certain moments. It is true that this movie needs to been seen at least twice to fully appreciate its intricacies. It's a family thing and somehow it is a combination of Miikie Takashi's Visitor Q, Seven and Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />Overall, I would say 7/10.<br /><br />I would recommend Frailty (2001) from Bill Paxton to people who like this plot.<br /><br />"
14500_0,"When the comedy channel comes out with content like this, it makes me wonder why the Canadian government forces channels to have Canadian content. Because that is the only explanation as to why this show ever existed... As filler to appease the law so the Comedy channel would have ""Canadian"" shows on.<br /><br />Frankly the writers are probably the worst in the history of television. If I could send them an open letter, it would beg them to retire immediately and move to Slovenia where the locals might find their off-topic humour funny.<br /><br />The case is even worse too. Elvira Kurt is painful as the host, standing there saying line one liners and praying for the audience to laugh. She should never return to television in any way shape or form. In fact, she should be the one paddling the boat of writers to Slovenia. The rest of the case should swim alongside it, because they don't even deserve a seat in the boat.<br /><br />Bad, no name guests, bad questions, bad casting, bad writing. You'd have to live in a box to have let this show run for more than one season, or you really really hate your viewers. Your pick.<br /><br />If there is divine justice, god will strike down this show."
14546_0,"When I first saw this movie I was like 3 or 4 years, and I thought of it as one of the greatest adventures in the world. But after a short while I realized there are many sad parts in it, especially the good bye party. I'm 21 now, and I'm still watching this movie over and over. I found out that no other cartoon has as beautiful loving parts filled with love as this one, but on the other side it is one of the most negative cartoons I've ever seen. <br /><br />Remember, right at the beginning Charlie Brown cuts his hand and is yelling at Snoopy. The other day Snoopy is very drastically fighting with Linus over a blanket(?). Next he goes boxing with with Lucy, ends up with a shoe in his face. Then we see as Lila is in the hospital, very sad music under it. Then Snoopy is thrown out of the beach because of the NO DOGS ALLOWED sign. He runs away from home to see Lila and meets this little girl who wants to keep Snoopy and Woodstock. Turns out to be a freak and beats Snoopy because of the tea SHE spills out on his dress. After they try to run away she takes Snoopy to the Vet where by sounds we can assume some pretty bad things happening. Meanwhile Charlie Brown is really sad. Snoopy gets to the hospital after a journey full of NO DOGS ALLOWED signs. Snoopy is hesitating with whom to stay Lila or Charlie. Snoopy goes home to say good-bye to his friends which is the saddest part in the movie. Snoopy goes to Lila and while leaving his Doghouse with the ""For sale or to let"" sign on it Woodstock runs after him crying while we can hear this really sad song in the background which later Charlie Brown is singing in his deep depression. This is the last sad part in the movie thank God, because when I'm watching it I cant manage to watch the whole movie with dry eyes. <br /><br />Thus the movie has VERY beautiful and happy and lovely parts in it. One of my favorite parts is when Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown are at the amusement park and are talking about love and Charlie touches Patty's hand.<br /><br />This movie has marked my life for a lifetime positively and negatively. When I'm sad I just think of how Snoopy begins to laugh in the library. No wonder I always get upset when see somebody kick someone in the leg like Snoopy did to Linus,etc.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to everyone because its beautiful, but warn children with weaker soul( I just cant find the right expression), because it can leave serious marks in a child's life. You can never get enough of this movie.Its brilliant Its beautiful yet very disturbing."
14591_0,"There's no question that Andy Milligan's film work was influenced by Andy Warhol. That doesn't downgrade the late Mr. Milligan at all-- no doubt when he was putting together plays in the 1950s, much of the aesthetic seen in VAPORS and FLESHPOT ON 42nd STREET was already intact. It's as if Warhol influenced the film-making, yet Tennessee Williams influenced the content. I thought Milligan's VAPORS (see my review) was a masterpiece, treating loneliness, desperation, and sexual confusion in a bold and honest way. You don't have to be bisexual or gay to find the humanity and universality in such a film. For me, FLESHPOT is equally fine. If VAPORS was reminiscent of early Warhol, when Andy himself was at the camera, FLESHPOT is reminiscent of the Paul Morrissey era. There's no Joe Dallesandro here, but Milligan was never about ""stars"" the way Warhol was. This is the story of two people who are sexually confused and sexually frustrated, and find that they have to ""hustle"" on every level of their existence. They may be in the gutter, but they both have somewhere inside them a spark of romance and dreams of a better life...somehow, somewhere. Neil Flanagan (aka ""Lynn"" Flanagan) brings a lot of depth to the role of queen Cherry Lane--sweet one moment, bitchy another moment; kind and considerate, but then thoughtless. Flanagan is, of course, familiar to any Milligan fan because of playing GURU in GURU THE MAD MONK. Diana Lewis's other credits seem to be mostly porn, but she makes the role of Dusty uncomfortably real. Everyone has known a few Dustys--the person who moves in with someone and basically provides sexual favors in return for room and board and some occasional pocket money. A number of people have BEEN Dustys at some low period in their lives. She is hard-bitten, cynical, knows how to manipulate the gullible, but she too has a dream of a better life that even the sleazy New York underbelly has not snuffed out. Some people manage to find a way out, or move somewhere else and reinvent themselves successfully, but many do not, and this is their story. The jumpy 16mm photography of Milligan's legendary Auricon camera almost becomes a participant in the film, and makes everything alive and moving, the way it does in real life. There's a lot of attention to dialogue in Milligan's 60s and early 70s work--the man may have been essentially a playwright. When it works well, Milligan's dialogue works as well as some of the later, less symbolic, more explicit Tennessee Williams plays. This being an Andy Milligan film, there are no happy endings, but this film would be phony and insincere if it offered one. FLESHPOT ON 42nd STREET is an honest look at characters living in an urban jungle, a place where if you don't take advantage of the next person you meet, that person will take advantage of you. Milligan does not judge these characters; he finds the humanity within them. This is equal to the best of the Warhol-Morrissey films, and in its own right is an impressive piece of work that seems more accurate and more rich the older I get and the more I've lived. Don't wait three decades for someone to proclaim this a masterpiece and one of the most significant ""windows"" into the early 70's, and for it to be shown at some film festival alongside TAXI DRIVER--score a copy now."
14636_0,"A great made after the comedy Hum Tum. Kunal have done a brilliant job. He had wrote the dialogs, the story brilliantly. I think its totally different film of Indian cinema. As bollywood freak I recommend this film to all audience even to kids too. Its has huge stars and brilliant director. Kunal gave his best even more than Hum Tum. Way to go Kunal you surely winning in this year. Nominations for sure even awards too. I believe you deserve more this year than Karan Johar from KANK. The direction you made has been the best. I even liked KANK but after I saw Fanaa I think its a way different film and making its mark separate from all films from past. The direction of Kunal has been the best direction I seen so far this year. This film should win the best-playback and direction as well. The film stars huge cast for sure. It has Rishi Kapoor whom I really adore. He is brilliant even in small role of a father. Aamir Khan is superb just superb. I can't even say in words how he gave his performance. Great comeback from KAJOL. I am a huge fan of her since I began seeing films. Kajol is the best actress ever of new generation.<br /><br />After K3G she has made a great come back. Her performance is just brilliant. Its just marvelous. She was truly character in the film. It for one second you can't say that she is not acting as blind. Her acting is better than Rani from black. I don't say Rani didn't act good but she was good but Kajol is the best in blind role. The film is a must see. When you think you know whats happening but the second next you don't. The dialogs are written brilliantly. The lyrics are just very touchy. The music is worth it that you can't even comment because it's from the soul. Sonu sang the song beautifully. The Tere haath main mera haath ho. This song is sang by Sonu Nigam beautifully. I think he should win awards this year from this song from Fanaa. The tittle song from Kank he also sang brilliantly but he sang this song even better. Yashraj are still ruling. Making the greatest movies. Bollywood awards sometimes are differ from our choices but if i was the jury I would the award for best director of this film. I would also give Sonu for best playback singer from Tere Haath mein Mera haath ho. I would also give the award for best story and dialogs . An excellent film. I am sure this film is getting many awards but these i mentioned I think it should be the winners. As far as acting Kajol is the best and should get an award too. Aamir is brilliant but I think Shah Rukh has acted better in KANK. Kirron Kher is in both so i can't say but she is not much in this film. I give this film 1000000 out of 1000000."
14681_0,"'The Night Watchman' was the debut directional effort by that great master of animation, Chuck Jones. Typical of Jones's serviceable but rather dull Disney pastiches that characterised his early work, 'The Night Watchman' is an unbearably gooey little offering with a constant lack of energy that is sorely required to bolster the wafer thin plot. A young cat (a clear prototype for Jones's cloying early character Sniffles) takes over the post of night watchman when his father is too ill to carry out the job. Immediately, he falls foul of some tough guy rats who push him around and take advantage of the absence of any real threat to gorge themselves with food and have a big night out in the kitchen. Of course, the cat finally turns the tables when his conscience buoys him up for a big final showdown. Betraying none of the talent he would become famous for (and, let's be fair, this was his first film), Jones lays out the story in a straightforward, no-frills manner. The characters are all severely lacking in charisma, particularly the so-wet-you-almost-don't-feel-sorry-for-him cat, the animation is lumbering and predictable, the musical number is flat and the story doesn't build naturally, instead resorting to a tacked on and completely unsatisfying finale in which the cat does a too-sudden about face and metes out a workmanlike beating to each individual rat, a production line revenge that is less than thrilling to watch. Of course, Warner Bros. was still finding its feet as an animation studio and 'The Night Watchman' is not significantly worse than many of the lesser cartoons of the time but, other than its historical importance as Jones's debut, there's really nothing here that I'd recommend to the casual cartoon fan."
14726_0,"Just for Madhuri Dixit! This is MD's first movie role since Devdas (2002) and it is worth a watch just to see the India's beauty on screen again.<br /><br />HOWEVER...THE MOVIE'S PLOT LINE SUCKED. It was beyond ridiculous and boring and unrealistic at best. Plus, Madhuri Dixit (now a mother of 2 boys) certainly did hold back in her acting, as she is known as being a bold, confidant type of female character.<br /><br />The songs are good, and the movie has a number of great actors such as Madhuri, Akshaye Khanna, Konkona Sen Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Kunal Kapoor and Divya Dutta.<br /><br />However, Madhuri if possible should return to films but accept small supporting roles as well (such as Rani Mukherjee's character in Saawariya) because there won't be a great shooting load and she has aged and no longer can carry a film judging by Aaja Nachle's failure.<br /><br />AGain, I do say watch the film if you want to see Madhuri again, the movie does solely get a 7/10 for her presence (or else it would get a 2/10) or watch one of her other films instead such as HAHK, Devdas or even Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam.<br /><br />Also, there should have been more focus on her relationship with Akshaye Khanna than the ""theatre play"" and politics."

14816_0,"This French movie, written and directed by women (two different ones), falls squarely into the serial killer genre, or so it initially seems. It starts off rather typical, a mousy but beautiful blonde woman, Claire, who sports glasses (to show her extreme mousiness) and is often filmed wearing a tightly wrapped wool coat and painful-looking high heels, works as an insurance agent who examines people filing claims. She's a bit proper and a bit pushed around, as we come to see as her co-workers unload their work on her because they know she won't say no. She is married to a somewhat unambitious photographer husband, played by the yummy Jonathan Zaccai (I bought a ticket for this movie because of him, I'll admit it) and has a daughter, aged around 5 or 6, who is afraid of the dark. So far so good. We have a boring nuclear family.<br /><br />Claire also has a ""wild"" friend Valerie. How do we know she's wild? She sleeps around a lot, dumps her boyfriends after one month, and in one particularly annoying scene, hears a song she likes on the radio, turns it up, and starts dancing wildly, much to Claire's bemusement. Yup, that slut has to die! She is essentially the opposite of Claire. Brunette whereas Claire is blonde, sexually and personally ""liberated"", while Claire is a slave to her family and job, wisecracking where Claire is austere.<br /><br />Anyway, Claire investigates a vet's office, where the basement has flooded. We get an eerie scene, where the vet, Laurent, leaves Claire to walk around the dark, flooded basement, and from that moment on, the tension begins to build. To make a long story short, Laurent and Claire hit it off, Laurent initially doing more of the hitting until Claire falls in love with him, and he starts to back off. Why? Because he's got daddy issues and he feels the need to carve up slutty ladies and sees Claire as ""different"", someone he could actually love. For the first time in his life (cue the music).<br /><br />This is where the film gets interesting. The audience knows Laurent is the killer, (at least I think we are supposed to) and as the story progresses, we start to actually like him. There's a key point here, up until late in the film we never see him kill anybody and that contributes greatly to our process of sympathizing. We see the Laurent that Claire sees. All until one scene, where we see a murder so graphic, so no-holds-barred, that we are shocked at our previous opinions. It's a brilliant cinematic move, arresting, indicting, grotesque.<br /><br />However, Claire is not totally innocent either, as news reports of a man killing women with a scalpel arise, Claire begins to question what Laurent might be moonlighting as. Yes, she knows it and she can't bring herself to leave him alone, because she starts to feel- alive, which begs the question, does she like him for him or because he's a serial killer? She loses the glasses (isn't it interesting how actors never actually need the glasses they wear?), starts to wear makeup, leaves her home late at night to meet up with Laurent at seedy bars- we're very close to S&M territory here, but Fontaine never takes that route. We learn small things about Claire, such as when she was a child, she was forgotten at the beach by her family, or that when she was an adolescent, she used to cut herself to remind herself that she was living. Laurent just listens, passing no judgment, knowing his levels of craziness far outweigh hers.<br /><br />I don't know which aspect of the movie is starker, the fact that Claire sympathizes with a serial killer, or that we do. Laurent is essentially like the sleeping lion? tiger? that we see him treat, potentially ferocious but sweet when asleep.<br /><br />The film ends with a beautiful but ambiguous shot of Claire alone, walking towards the ferris wheel that she and Laurent rode together previously in the film. Ferris wheels seem to me to be emblematic of youth, innocence, first dates, first kisses, all of course from previous cinematic treatments of them, and I think one of the film's themes is innocence, the innocence of not knowing, of love, of hoping, of children, of animals, and the inevitable corruption of that innocence.<br /><br />cococravescinema.blogspot.com"
14861_0,"""The Godfather"" of television, but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters, the two are nothing alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband, and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually derive from his mother Livia, who's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and latching. Chianese, the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are ""okay"" but not notable (with the exception of Iler's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode, ""The Second Coming""); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong for them to hold it back. Even as the show continues for over six season, it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment.<br /><br />**** (out of four)"
14906_0,"I agree with the critics who lambasted 'Beyond Borders', a film with the intellectual depth of an infomercial that portrays starving children to elicit donations. Similarly, the filmmakers' methods undermine their intentions, if their intentions were in fact as noble as many of the other reviewers here seem to think. If they sought to inspire viewer sympathy and support, the filmmakers succeeded. Personally, I feel for the extras exploited in the film, and I support any viewer who stopped watching within the first hour.<br /><br />If this were merely Angelina Jolie's latest bit of entertaining fluff, I could forgive the film for its shortcomings as a star vehicle designed to exhibit the actress' ample charms. Here, however, Jolie is cast in a serious role as a UN relief worker whose only contributions to the relief effort appear to be her wealth, her compassion, and her ability to strike a pose during a bad situation. I could almost hear Isaac Misrahi cooing at Jolie's miraculously kempt appearance and missionary-chic ensembles. Are we meant to applaud Sarah (Jolie) for not wearing perfume after Nick's ridicule, even when we can see faint traces of mascara on her drooping eyelids as she broods in Chechnya? The attention to Sarah's impeccable appearance detracts from a film that seemingly condemns such superficial concerns in light of human suffering throughout the world. Moreover, it contributes to the overall hypocrisy of a movie meant to galvanize social reflection and reaction through the didactic speeches of its belligerent protagonist Nick (Clive Owen), while exhibiting remarkable indifference to the objectification of the nameless victims that suffer and die in the film so that our love is not for them, but for the named heroes who suffer and die out of pity.<br /><br />In 'Beyond Borders', the world is a simple place in which the problems of Chechnya, Cambodia, and Ethiopia are conflated to represent Third World issues for which compassion is the panacea. Perhaps if this were true, I could appreciate Sarah's sudden ill-conceived trip to Ethiopia at the beginning of the movie, thus precipitating her future involvement with the UN. Why not admire her for responding to Nick's impassioned plea for more funding at a dinner in London when her peers are cruel and apathetic? For starters, the fact that she is so moved by one incident is more indicative of her obliviousness before the pivotal event than any admirable quality attributed to her reactionary social conscience. Amidst her tears, Nick's speech, and the audience's jeers, a little boy is humiliated to make a point. Worse, a fracas ensues, and his separation from Nick leads to the boy's demise. Sarah's journey to Ethiopia is as senseless as his death, but 'Beyond Borders' seemingly justifies these events by implying that irrationality is at the heart of all worthwhile endeavors. Nick, after all, is as irrational as Sarah. In his recklessness and outrage at the human suffering he encounters as a Third World doctor, Nick is an ineffective negotiator and fundraiser. He is subsequently forced to resort to an uneasy alliance with an insipid trafficker in weaponry and other questionable goods. His actions lead to plot complications involving the relief workers, but the social consequences for the local populations they endeavor to help remain unexplored. Even when Nick later expresses his guilt over the little boy's death, I wonder if we are meant to feel sorry for him or the boy.<br /><br />Nick is the cynical foil for Sarah's naïve idealist, but, predictably, the initial hostility between them turns to attraction. It's inevitable, I suppose, that the two beautiful do-gooders exchange a few clichéd remarks about the state of the world before tumbling into bed. First, however, they share meaningful glances during Sarah's short stay in Ethiopia. The shipment of provisions she brings with her lasts only a few days, and as her only occupation involves feeding milk to an extremely malnourished boy whom she rescued from certain death, she leaves. Her bedside vigil earns her the respect of the relief workers, but the film does not question the outcome of her actions. It becomes apparent that Sarah's act, along with her mediocre piano playing, is supposed to endear her to Nick. Never mind that her efforts are short-lived and that she abandons the now motherless child to suffer the cruelties of a prolonged existence alone.<br /><br />What more can we expect from a film that suggests food shortages are the root of famine, evil is the cause of war, and apathy is the sole impediment to social change? If only things were so simple. One of the many problems facing relief efforts is that policymakers are unwilling to explore and fund long-term solutions that have enduring consequences but less immediate results, and thus this film, in its glorification of thoughtless emotion and quick solutions, actually hinders such efforts. Moreover, its neocolonial view of the locals in Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Chechnya as savage criminals or helpless victims is derogatory and condescending. These are not people, but stereotypes ripped from the headlines of sensationalist magazines.<br /><br />This film contends that Sarah, in her facile understanding of the situations she encounters, can somehow rescue the world from its own depravity by accompanying trucks carrying needed supplies across ravaged terrain. What ethnocentric, ignorant conceit to think that she could provide aid without adequate knowledge of the local languages, people, or customs! Then again, all Third World countries are the same in their shared devastation, and Sarah cares, right? Good intentions are no excuse for inexcusable actions or bad film-making. Why doesn't Sarah combat poverty in London or address the needs of her family, which she abandons to endanger her life in reckless pursuit of Nick? The answer's obvious: Then there would be no tragic soap opera against an exotic backdrop of human suffering. It is unfortunate that Sarah and Nick need the exploitation of others to add meaning to their bland love story."
14951_0,"STUPID! I think when they rank the worst 100, it should be done relative to the film's budget. If so, Air Force One should qualify. The story is completely asinine. The characters all behave recklessly and ridiculously. Only the redoubtable Jurgen Prochnow manages to come out of this mess with his dignity intact. <br /><br />Harrison Ford is the least Presidential-acting US President ever to appear on film -- and that includes the likes of Polly Bergen, John Ritter, and Donald Pleasance. Gary Oldham is every cold-war caricature mixed together, then run amok, all wrapped up in a preposterous accent, overblown mannerisms, and a maniacal laugh. Xander Berkeley's stunt was almost as impossible as his wooden performance. Paul Guilifoyle is the most disloyal and ignorant Chief-of-Staff ever depicted. Wendy Crewson is doing a nothing job, and does less with it. <br /><br />The pacing is so painstakingly slow, it was hard to believe this was an action movie. The special effects were labored and cumbersome, and the score was a near-perfect parody of action movie scores.<br /><br />I had to write all this because IMDB no longer accepts four-line reviews. If they did, I simply would have written: STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID, etc."
14997_0,"A military mapping operation goes awry and lands a helicopter in a hidden volcanic crater with live dinosaurs.<br /><br />This movie oozes potential. A reasonable script, decent actors, good pacing, spectacular sets, and the grandeur of CinemaScope. Then you see the dinosaurs.... oh lord, do you ever. One can easily see where their budget ran dry. The movie employs the two worst methods of portraying dinosaurs, and doesn't even do it well. However, the compositing is nearly seamless, so if it were possible, one could become convinced that the producers managed to find a 20 foot tall man to wear a full size Tyrannosaurus costume.<br /><br />Aside from the special effects, the movie is quite good, nearly rising above B-movie status. The actors all seem for the most part, naturalistic. They all seem to find the line between flat and hammy. The movie never wastes much time on non-essential plot elements, and the running time works out quite well.<br /><br />Recommanded for those who love the genre type, be it dinosaurs or jungle movies."
15040_0,"This movie has something for everyone, comedy romance back in a time when Disney knew how to make a family film. The Love bug is the story of a man who meets an extraordinary car and how said car changes his life. This movie has a bit of everything, comedy, appeal to kids, romance, racing, Disney villains who are as likable as they are bad. One of the essential to watch Disney movies in my humble opinion. The background music really went to support the film. The footage wasn't always best shots but hey it was the 60s and I think it helps keep the feel of that era looking like that. Overall this movie is the reason that people know who Herbie is today and the reason he has become as iconic as many of their cartoon characters."

15176_0,"I saw this on October 1st, 2006 at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. I had the chance to briefly meet the writer/director and he is amazing! (and very humble) <br /><br />I've read the negative comments on this movie and I could not disagree with them more. The judgments they have made on the film are based on it being a realistic comedy when in fact it is a farce. It is sad the we have homogenized the categories of film so much that we really don't get to see outstanding examples of the diverse genres out there. ""Desperate Housewives"" (another guilty pleasure and a national hit) almost didn't make it to the airwaves because Marc Cherry was selling it as a farce and people did not know what that was. Sad, because Shakespeare did very well with the genre. ""DH"" had to be categorized as a soap opera before the networks would pick it up. Here is the definition of ""farce"": <br /><br />1. a light, humorous play in which the plot depends upon a skillfully exploited situation rather than upon the development of character. 2. humor of the type displayed in such works. 3. foolish show; mockery; a ridiculous sham. <br /><br />That said, this is a great movie that is hilarious to experience. I was one of many that despite the reviews and comments LOVED the first movie. It was not without flaw, but overall, it was wonderful. This one was in my opinion slightly better. Yes, it had stereotypes and ridiculous situations (see definition of farce above). That structure allowed some very clever dialogue, some hilarious scenes, and some mockery of society's need to categorize ""gay"" into any specific pigeon hole. This movie makes fun of those stereotypes, and in the process gives you the chance for introspection after the film.<br /><br />I think the actors (male and female) do an incredible job. Rebekah Kochan (Tiffani) has done a body transformation since the first installment. She looked good in the first one, she looks amazing in this one. Both Emily and Jim are fun to watch. The hot guys... well, they are very enjoyable to watch. I was a little afraid that I wouldn't like the character of Marc in this sequel (he was played by Ryan Carnes, now famous for his role in ""Desperate Housewives"" as Bree's son's boyfriend... in the sequel he is played by Brett Chukerman). By the second scene Brett was in, I was hooked. He did a great job of taking over an existing character.<br /><br />Overall, if you go into this film seeking reality, you will walk away disappointed. If you go in looking for a good time and realize it is supposed to be a farce, you will leave with a smile on your face from the laughter and poignant moments in the film. Mink Stole's final scene in the movie actually brought a tear to my eye. What gay son wouldn't want to hear her comments? :)<br /><br />I would say, check it out."
15220_0,"when i saw it in a dark saloon. I was really scared.. Nice young actors and 5 great bad guys. They are all perfectly described.. Especially Nejat Isler.. He is really strong in this movie. The violence is used very good in the film. Based on a true story is the scariest part of the film. When you watch it you keep on thinking ""Dude.. These are all real...Some people have really been beaten like this and some girls were raped in front of their boyfriends.."" So if you are ready to see some real violence..I mean Real! ( because these kinds of things happen in world ) Watch ""Barda""..Also if you like it you can watch "" Gemide "" and ""Lalelide Bir Azize"" too.."
15266_0,"I got this movie in a Troma gift box and it was titled ""Video Demons Do Psychotown"". Now, judging by the cover and description on the back, about 45 minutes into the movie I thought I may have gotten the wrong disc packaged in my case. So I paused it and looked at the box again. The cover featured a man in a Mohawk popping out of a TV screen and the movie description promised things like ""video demons control your every move"" and a ""gruesome journey into a world of subliminal psychic nightmares"". Sure enough there were 3 stills from the flick on the back.<br /><br />In actuality this movie is a boring murder mystery flick about two college students finishing up a documentary for a film school final project. Both leads are wooden and this movie features some lame ass love scenes. There is a lot of talking and repetition none of which builds up to any kind of climax in the end. There are a total of 3 murders and about 4 or 5 love scenes over the course of 90 minutes. That breakdown right there should clue you into what a total snooze-fest this picture is.<br /><br />And Troma, be a little more honest with your packaging. No one likes to be baited and switched like that and it's no wonder why this dud was slipped into the ""Toxie's Top Ten"" gift box."
15310_0,"This film could have drove it's ""point"" home a lot better than presented. It should have stayed CLEAR away from the feel of the 70's type ""blaxpoitation"" films. But this film was not so bad at all.<br /><br />It tells a story, a story of a big time 70's guy who's soul has not been put to rest. He has a vendetta, dead or not, he needed to see it to its full completion. (Ya know, similar to George W. Bush and his Iraq thing.)<br /><br />Ernest Dickerson is a darn excellent cinematographer and director of photography. In the 80's I enjoyed his work on ""Tales From The Darkside"" and I can see he was headed for it here. Trouble is, in feature film, audiences expect more. Progression is the key, and Ernest went for a 70's blaxpoitation thing here instead of just telling the tale as it should be.<br /><br />Snoop Dog actually did a good job for the material here. If nothing else, this was his audition tape for the feature film: ""Starsky and Hutch"".<br /><br />The stereotypical parts for the other actors is what turned me off. (Turned me off in the 70's as well.) which is why this film could have done without it.<br /><br />But it is an entertaining film. Good for your adult Halloween Party if everyone there is over 35 to recall the movie days of ""Foxy Brown"", ""Blacula"" and ""Black Cesear""."
15356_0,"Evil Spawn (1987) was a cheaply produced film that reeks of poverty. You have a good premise but it's faulty execution has no real pay off. A couple of good scenes does not a movie make. Too bad, because the actresses were good looking (especially the brunette) and the idea was solid. Maybe they should have a better story writer and a little more imagination. I saw this movie a few years ago at a Mr. Video store (rest in peace). Back then the cheesy video cover screamed cheap-cheap. I should have listened to my head instead of my eyes. Oh well. Perhaps a film-maker with more on the ball would make a better production.<br /><br />An aging actress will do anything to look young again (my advice is to stay out of the sun lady). So she comes across a crazy old scientist and his shady associate. He's working on an experimental formula that'll reduce the signs of aging (the good doctor should have used a little dab himself me thinks). But before he can work out all of the ""bugs"", tragedy occurs but that doesn't stop the old B-Queen from using it.<br /><br />The story might sound interesting but please stay away unless YOU REALLY like bad movies. Because there is really no need for someone (or anyone) to watch this ""movie"". Maybe next time they should concentrate more on the adult aspect of the storyline.<br /><br />Best to avoid.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the hot brunette this one would get a zero or a negative rating."
15400_0,"Whirlygirl was premiered two nights ago at the New Haven Film Festival. The film was shot largely in New Haven, especially the New York scenes. The bulk of director Jim Wilson's film experience has come from producing 6 Kevin Costner films: Revenge, Dances With Wolves, The Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, The Postman, and Message in a Bottle. So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to find wooden acting and poor writing in this film, even though Mr. Costner is nowhere to be found. Monet Mazur is certainly beautiful, but her performance is embarrassingly hammy; and the script is, in places, just terrible. But the guys aren't bad, and the scenes in the boys' school are fun. And Fran Kranz is always enjoyable to watch."

I recommend this short film for all and especially for youth groups, but suggest it be previewed by leaders before group showings in order to develop responses to questions that your audiences will have. The Bonus Tracks, interviews with Principal members of the production, may be necessary to resolve questions of your own and will assist in leading discussion about A Distant Thunder.<br /><br />Because of the powerful theme of this movie, I suggest that it not be shown to unsupervised children or youth."
15491_0,"A fairly humdrum retelling of the Chicago gangster wars of the 20s & 30s and in particular Elliot Ness' long term battle bringing top gangster Al Capone to book on a range of charges from murder, prohibition & bootlegging to his eventual downfall of simple tax evasion.<br /><br />De Palma does a pretty bad hash with this movie. Firstly, he is hard pushed into thinking of any original cinematography he can genuinely call his own. The most blatant rip off is the ""Odessa Steps"" scene at the train station which was originally done so masterfully decades ago in the Russian film Battleship Potyomkin (1925).<br /><br />And I doubt if the real Ness swaned around in designer clothes back in the 20s either. But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.<br /><br />Then we have the actors. Connery really does amaze me sometimes. He plays Malone a bit like Office Dibble out of Top Cat, unsure of what accent to use and always coming out with words of wisdom but never really convincing us with any true conviction. Although his death scene was quite moving otherwise he was as wooden as a beer keg.<br /><br />Costner again excels as a man with a total charisma bypass. He sparkles from time to time but generally he just plods through the story in his customary dot to dot style.<br /><br />The only shining light would be De Nero as the Big C himself. Totally convincing, totally ruthless, played just right - never drifting into characature, never falling into cliche, De Nero is excellent. And of course who can forget his little baseball story around the dinner table!<br /><br />The only criticism with De Nero is that we don't get to see enough of him; we don't get the chance to absorb his character or understand his evil mannerisms. De Palma offers simple sign posting telling the audience that this guy is all bad and that's all you need to know.<br /><br />The supporting cast give a good account of themselves, especially Garcia & Martin-Smith. <br /><br />The production values are obviously high & lavish but all this eye candy & stylish camera work doesn't make for a good film with an underworked script. De Palma is too heavy handed with his character development with regards the good guys - hense the heavy emphasis on Ness being a good family man, doting wife, child & baby on the way. All done in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.<br /><br />The musical score is very upbeat & concise which is perhaps the only good thing about the movie; that and some decent lighting & 2nd unit camera work.<br /><br />Overall, a film full of other people's ideas packaged with 80's designerism & style over content but with nothing new to offer. **/*****"
15536_0,"Wow, I really enjoyed this show! The acting, story and effects were great. The cast seemed to work well together, it's too bad that Justin Hartley is now on Smallville. For a pilot, the show was great and showed a LOT of potential! Wow, what was the CW thinking by not picking it up?! The pilot had action, mystery sex appeal. People were expecting great things from this show and the CW screwed it up without even getting it on the air. They're crazy. Hopefully the huge success and huge number of downloads on i Tunes will make them change their minds... hopefully. With an average rating of 4 and a half stars, I don't know what CW is waiting for!"
15581_0,"""Invisible Stripes"" is by no means a great film but I enjoy the heck out of it. Any crime picture that has George Raft and Humphrey Bogart is going to be worth a look. Here they play two cons: Raft planning to go straight and provide for his Mom and kid brother while Bogey returns to his criminal ways. There are so many interesting angles to this picture for true film buffs. First, Raft's younger brother is played by 21 year old William Holden in his second film. Watching him in this it is amazing he made many more; he is pretty whiny and forgettable as the hotheaded sibling. The great British actress Flora Robson plays their mother in a colossal bit of miscasting but since her role is minimal she retains her dignity (although some of the lovey-dovey exchanges with her movie son Raft are borderline incestuous). Bogey is his typical brilliant self and easily walks off with the picture. While he is continuing his cycle of bad-guy supporting roles his character is not without some redeeming features. Cast as his moll is Lee Patrick; the two would combine again in a couple of years as Sam Spade & Effie Perrine in ""The Maltese Falcon."" Another interesting footnote in the film is the brief appearance of Leo Gorcey as a department store clerk.<br /><br />And finally I come to the star, George Raft. He has gained a reputation as a mercilessly wooden performer and some of it is deserved. I have always liked him and find this performance relatively solid; he is acted off the screen by Bogart in their scenes together and his one shot at emoting over his plight as an ex-con is comical but in the overall he is very likable. This is the kind of role Raft wanted to play: the tough guy who is good to his Ma, loyal to his friends, and possessing a strict code of ethics. Despite turning down nearly every role that made Bogart a star, Raft's brief career at Warners represents his best work.<br /><br />If you are a fan of old Warners crime pictures you will have a good time with ""Invisible Stripes."""
15626_0,"What a horrible, irredeemable waste of celluloid. We found ourselves wishing for the boat to sink, Malkovich, Deneuve et al to be devoured by sharks. It's a shame, because the concept had potential. Unfortunately, there is no character development, no plot, and the dialogue is as hackneyed as something between a group of pompous 18-year old students with an affectation for existentialism.<br /><br />To add insult to viewer injury, de Oliveira assumes the viewer has zero knowledge of the most pedestrian tourist destinations in the Mediterranean. The film is little more than a Lonely Planet guidebook for schoolchildren, with an eye-rollingly vapid dinner conversation between actors who should have known better.<br /><br />Before someone sets up a Rambo strawman, the two of us who viewed this are admittedly pretentious cinema buffs. Nothing can redeem this tour de merde though. The only way I'd recommend this film would be for a group of second-year Portuguese language students, if the professor doesn't have time for a lesson plan one week.<br /><br />This horrible piece of dreck belongs on Andorran Public Broadcasting on Sunday night, just after the documentary on the making of Roquefort cheese. I'd rather be hogtied in a room with the roadcrew from Queen and a jar of KY jelly mixed with sand before ever being exposed to something this wicked and satanic again.<br /><br />Puke."

Cheech Marin goes solo in this unfunny farce as a U.S. citizen who is wrongly deported to Mexico and tries to make it back to his L.A. home. Cheech tries his best to make it in Hollywood on his own, but without Chong, the hilarity just isn't there, and the movie's message is dismally pointless.

15716_0,"I read Dodie Smith's 'I Capture The Castle' about three years ago and found it a charming and engrossing read. I looked forward to the film and have just watched on the BBC. I was pleasantly surprised with the film because I thought that it would put people off the book but the casting was very good for all of the characters. <br /><br />The main problem was the fact that with the book, it is written as a diary with Cassandra's thoughts about everything but in the film, the viewer just got a brief comment about the several situations. Despite this, the film was sweet and the actress playing Cassandra is perfect. Not exactly how I imagined it but films hardly ever beat the books. I give it 7.5/10"

15806_0,"Chuck Jones's 'No Barking' was the third in a trilogy of cartoons starring a character called Frisky Puppy. An immensely entertaining character, Frisky Puppy is a masterclass in observation, capturing the mannerisms of an irritatingly energetic puppy to a tee. Co-starring in 'No Barking' is another of Jones's best lesser-known players, Claude Cat. The cartoon opens with an exceptional sequence in which Claude wakes up in an urban junkyard with the sort of tranquil serenity that befits a far more idyllic setting. This gorgeous piece of animation sets the standard for this mini-masterpiece. Claude crosses paths with Frisky Puppy who scares the life out of him with his shrill, relentless barking, causing Claude to leap into the air in fright. Having done this once, the puppy finds it is fun and sets about terrorising Claude for the rest of the cartoon. Although it sounds like a mean concept, Frisky Puppy is so warm a character that it is immediately apparent that to him this is just a game rather than a vendetta. Jones skilfully makes the character a perfect balance between sweet and infuriating. The barking sound he makes is so grating and loud that it gets funnier the more it occurs, reducing Claude to a nervous wreck. The main action is interspersed with some beautiful animation of the puppy just being a puppy, switching from happy to confused to angry in a split second as he goes about his playful antics. This gives the cartoon a delightfully loose, plot less feel as we simply follow the two characters around until their paths cross. Although a good deal of credit for 'No Barking' must be given to Jones and writer Michael Maltese, a special mention is warranted for animator Ken Harris who animated the entire cartoon himself. The result is stunning."

I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />In the movie of the popular ITV Sitcom Please Sir, teacher Bernard Hedges is angry that his class, 5C, the worst in the school, can't go on a school trip. He manages to get them on a trip, to the country. Trouble on the coach is just the start. Naturally there is trouble there. Problems include the fact that Dunstable's parents didn't sign, he got the signature forged, 5C being found in the pub and 5C's room vandalised, surprisingly not by 5C. But on the good side, Bernard Hedges gets a date with an attractive blonde.<br /><br />Sitcom movies are never brilliant, but this was one of the better ones.

15941_0,"A wonderfully done historical biography of the Austrian girl who eventually became the ill-fated queen of France during the French Revolution. Elegant, lavish production that spares no expense in flamboyant period costumes and majestic sets.<br /><br />Norma Shearer is magnificent in her portrayal of Marie from age 14, when she was betrothed to the future Louis XVI, through their awkward marriage, and the years of their monarchy, culminating with their tragic destiny. Shearer's Marie is a sympathetic character, a victim of her circumstances. She is not the self-indulgent Marie with a taste for extravagance, and a patronizing attitude towards the people. She doesn't utter the phrase often attributed to her, ""Let them eat cake."" Instead, she is the victim of Court politics and intrigue designed to falsely implicate her as an insensitive, distant, and selfish monster.<br /><br />Robert Morley is perfect in his role as the inept king who ascends to the throne at an early age, and probably lacked the smarts and the intestinal fortitude to perform the duties of a monarch no matter what age he had become king. Even though history paints him as inept and weak, the movie gives a heart to this unfortunate man (as it does for Marie) that evokes compassion and understanding. Although Marie's lover only existed in the tongue of gossip, the sequences with Tyrone Power added a passionate romantic flavor to the story, a definite plus with its dramatic contrast to the understated Marie/Louis relationship.<br /><br />The story of the downfall of these two is intelligently and logically constructed with a fine script, an enthusiastic cast that all shine in their roles, and an uncommonly well scripted dramatization. Avoid the ridiculous new version with its out of place '80's music and woefully anachronistic depiction of the French queen as a partying Valley girl. See this version instead."
15987_0,"I saw this film randomly the other day while at a friend's house. She comes from Indian decent and had always nagged me to watch tamil films with her but I always declined. Being a general film fanatic, I agreed to watch this film, not expecting much. But as soon as I got into the story (and got over the horrible and sometimes non-visible subtitles) I was completely hooked! Whether it was the directing or the wonderful screen presence of the actors, somethng about this film had the ability to capture the emotions of the viewer. I can say that having been used to watching generally Hindi films, february14 is a romance that stands out from the typical Hollywood love story -- paying attention to detail and character development in a way in which I've rarely seen before. Although I was quite new to Indian ""musical numbers"" in which they incorporate within their films and even found the performances in them a little bit on the cheesy side, I throroughly enjoyed some of the songs as well. Great melodies, especially the title song'un peyar ennada' -- which added to the emotional impact of the movie itself. I wll definitely be looking out for more Indian films in the future."

Unfortunately, the experiment goes awry, and Eddie suddenly develops a square afro, takes to wearing ankle boots, and sneaks out at night... and one of his first victims is an ugly white woman with a really bad hair-do and bad taste in pink nighties.<br /><br />On the surface, BLACKENSTEIN would seem everything a cult-movie fan could ever wish.

Trouble is, BLACKENSTEIN is also incredibly, unspeakably dull. In fact, it is so dull that after about ten minutes its dullness overpowers the giggle factor and you are left to sit in slack-jawed exhaustion.<br /><br />The DVD release of this film offers nothing in the way of extras and the print is bad to boot--not that it makes any difference where this film is concerned. If you have to buy a gift for some you don't much like, this would be a perfect choice. Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon reviewer"
16076_0,This was painful to watch as a Godzilla fan. There are five main reasons. 1) It was 'mushy'. (Godzilla is in all of us!- the stupid little girl) 2) The one fighting sequence lasted way too long. 3) The plot was not really that good. 4) The special effects looked like animation. 5) The character setup sucked. They either came or went quickly or stayed around to the point of exhaustion. I guess there's six. 6) the fight was commentated...*shudder*. Better alternatives include: every other Godzilla movie. nobody even died in this movie. I recommend watching a completely different movie. I think I'm going to retch just thinking about this crappy movie. Please may the studios who did this stop and go out of business.

16300_0,"""The Gray Zone"" transports the audience to the epicenter of evil during WWII's final solution to the Jewish question. The film deals with a group of doomed Jewish Auschwitz POW's who do the death camp's dirty work, herding unsuspecting Jews into the showers, carrying cadavers to the crematorium, harvesting the dead for gold dentalwork, etc. The film takes on a challenging subject with countless moral issues to ponder as it scrutinizes the nuts and bolts of mass extermination. However, it doesn't quite measure up to the potent subject with its theatrical presentation, clipped dialogue, time wasting filler, staginess, poor character depth, confusing language and dialect issues, and a rather contrived monologue at the end. Nonetheless, the films treats the subject with dignity, does not exploit or sensationalize, and recreates enough of the horror to impart a sense of what it must have been like giving it docudramatic value. Worth a look for anyone interested in the holocaust. (B)"

16391_0,"Buster Keaton always amazes me. He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema. And The General, even clocking in at around three hours, is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance alone.<br /><br />Granted, I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts, because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature, especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary, but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments. There are multiple points in the General, a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War, where Keaton's character, Johnnie Gray, has to stop his train, jump out, and remove something from the tracks, which in itself can be quite boring, but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertained.<br /><br />And it's a marvel how so many realistic, yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with. It's nothing fantastic like some of his other films, but it's still funny. And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversity--but he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and it's just enough to know that he is frightened, but that the rest of him doesn't react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny. Whether he's pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something he's unskilled in and being shocked by it, that response of his is winning.<br /><br />But the General does show its age a little. It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesn't get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context. I wouldn't dare cut those moments out of this film, even if I could re-edit it, because the space always had something going on, but at the same time, this film, if made today, would be cut to one-and-a-half, or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly. The plot and story are simple, but exist more than to just help the comedy move along--except at the end when the first story was accomplished. Then we move into a second extraneous, but still amusing, story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent, though simple, story.<br /><br />I didn't really love the score that the DVD company attached to it, which is a number of classical pieces end on end. I think a new commissioned soundtrack would've better matched the piece, but I guess we get what we get. And on the plus side, you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of it.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No. But despite the age it shows, it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinema's greatest physical comedians. If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown, this is not a bad way to go. 8/10."
16436_0,"Naturally, everyone has different tastes, and some people do like the movie - but in my opinion it was just another pointless movie about a bunch of bank robbers. I assume many people will watch it just to see Lynda Carter topless, but in today's world where porn sites pop up on computers all the time even when they are not wanted, there is no novelty in seeing a topless woman in a love scene - except that it's a celebrity and people are into that. A previous user (Ron) posted a message that the two topless scenes were really just the same film clip edited twice into the movie in two different scenes. However, he was mistaken. There were two very similar love scenes - in both scenes, they are making love on the same blanket, and in roughly the same positions and camera angles. It is almost like watching the same scene twice. But they did film it twice, and not a single frame was duplicated in both scenes."

It's such a great build-up to an exciting adventure...<br /><br />but once they end up taking the ship into space you might at as well turn it off. A complete shift in tone and intelligence.

Tarzan brings the baby to his tree house and shows it to Jane and they call it simply ""Boy"" and raise him as their own. The movie then goes on a few years and we see Boy swinging through the trees and swimming. A search party then comes looking for the plane and then discover Boy is the young couple's son. Jane reluctantly agrees to give him to his relations but they get kidnapped by headhunters but Boy runs to get Tarzan who brings with him a heard of elephants and the headhunters' village is trampled by these. Jane recovers from a wound after a spear went into her and everyone is OK at the end and Boy stays with Tarzan and Jane.<br /><br />As well as Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane, the cast also features Johnny Sheffeld in his first role as Boy, British actor Ian Hunter and Henry Stephenson.<br /><br />Watching Tarzan Finds a Son is a great way to spend an hour and 20 minutes one afternoon. Excellent.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5."
16571_0,"I am loathe to say something this negative, but must. One of the worst movies I ever have been dragged in front of the VCR by my fiancee to watch. It is not enjoyed but endured, especially, I would think, by males - as you will see for yourself (or, I hope, not). What was Robert Duvall thinking when he agreed just to go through the motions for this dud? And Julia Roberts?? The one note of hysterical she maintains throughout is not acting. At least the scenery in Beaufort, S.C. (also the location of ""Big Chill"") is interesting. Overall, what a disappointment."
16616_0,"Helpful Note: Wikipedia definition: Quid pro quo (Latin for ""something for something"") indicates a more-or-less equal exchange or substitution of goods or services. <br /><br />Carlos Brooks makes an impressive debut as both writer and director of this little independent film QUID PRO QUO, a story that may make some viewers uncomfortable because of the subject matter, but an intelligent investigation of a subculture unknown to most and a script that leads to a surprising ending - if the viewer keeps thinking after the rolling credits are over! <br /><br />Isaac (Nick Stahl) is a reporter for a small radio station, a role that gives him the opportunity to uncover novel human interest stories for his audience. Interestingly, Isaac is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair since age 8 when he was the survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents. He has full function of most of his body, but cannot walk. Isaac receives an email from one 'Ancient Chinese Girl' that contains a message about a person who convinced a doctor to amputate a normal leg. Isaac is fascinated and sets out to investigate the story and eventually discovers the source of the email - one young and very beautiful Fiona (Vera Farmiga) - who introduces him to a subculture of people who want to be wheelchair bound: in a group meeting Isaac hears strange stories from a disparate group of people who meet to discuss their obsession with being paralyzed, their chance to be noticed and cared about as quasi-invalids who would go so far as having an amputation of a normal limb to enable their wheelchair dreams. <br /><br />Isaac soon discovers that Fiona shares this obsession, demonstrates her secrets to Isaac, and the two begin to bond physically and emotionally. Isaac is the first person to see Fiona make her 'debut' in public in a wheelchair. They share lunch in a café and share their life experiences: Isaac confesses that he harbors foreshortened memory of his accident - his last memory is lying in the road seeing a young girl with red and white pompoms trying to save him. Isaac surprises himself (and shares his surprise with Fiona) when he buys a pair of 'Fred Astaire shoes', and upon trying them on, he is able to walk! Fiona's response is mixed - she is happy that Isaac is ambulatory but at the same time she is led to believe that Isaac's paralysis may be of an hysterical nature, that he really has never been paralyzed except as a reaction to the guilt he harbors about his parent's death and his sole survivorship of the accident. How these two people deal with the information as it develops provides a startling ending to this story, a detective mystery that in retrospect proves to have given us, the audience, countless clues throughout the film - clues only discovered in retrospect! <br /><br />Both Nick Stahl and Vera Farmiga give vital performances, able to draw us in to their odd characters and make us care. There are many fine cameo roles - Kate Burton as Fiona's mother, James Frain as Isaac's priest friend, and all the members of the wannabe wheelchair bound group - and the cinematography by Michael McDonough is both appropriately claustrophobic indoors and transcendently beautiful in the tulip fields of Skagit Valley, WA used as the setting for the upstate New York accident location. Mark Mothersbaugh ties the moods of the film together with his expert musical score. This is a tough little film to watch, but a film that supplies much gratification and challenge. It is a fine debut for Carlos Brooks. Recommended. Grady Harp"
16661_0,"Allan Felix (Woody Allen) is a quirky film critic who has very minimal success with the ladies after being dumped by his wife. With the help of his two friends (Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts) and an imaginary Humphrey Bogart, he attempts to find a mate, but falls for the wrong one.<br /><br />Like I said in the summary, I really don't find Woody Allen to be that great of an actor. Play it Again, Sam changed my mind! This is a lighthearted comedy that I found to be his greatest film. Woody Allen plays the same character he always plays in his movies, but I actually found him to be quite funny in this one. The whole idea of Humphrey Bogart teaching him how to get women was just hysterical to me also. Jerry Lacy was a wonderful Bogart and the on-screen chemistry between Keaton and Allen was as wonderful as in Annie Hall. Overall, Play it Again, Sam was a wonderful quirky comedy but defiantly contains Woody Allen humor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film."

He looked great in the role. One almost wonders why the Oscars didn't call on him more often.<br /><br />Shaft Roundtree made an excellent balance for him too. He did the hired muscle routine with a touch of class.<br /><br />I'm trying to figure out Shelly Winters role though. It seemed like the producers just wanted to hire her just to hire her.

16751_0,"The television series Futurama is nothing short of brilliant and in my opinion is the best television series ever. I personally do not actually like science fiction movies or series aside from this one show which i give an exception too.<br /><br />Futurama is easily leaps and bounds above the rest as it focuses substantially on character development and does avoid the common stereotype of ""a family"" as the focus. Instead the focuses of Futurama is simply several unique and hilarious work colleagues and there many adventures across the universe. What also is very unique is the characters are all different and each have there own opinions which provide an excellent contrast in the series. Another aspect of Futurama which surpasses other animation shows is the quality of the visuals. Futurama is notorious for having excellent visuals and has won several Emmy's for its animation achievement. The positives do not stop there; Futurama is amazing at portraying an amazing amount of emotion into the episodes that at some times had my holding back tears. This level of emotion is not even present in the Simpson's.<br /><br />One final positive thing worth saying is that the show is able to appeal to all audiences, not just sci-fi lovers. For example by 50-year old mother can't stand sci-fi and she absolutely loves the show. The series itself does however contain some sexual humor that is structured rather uniquely to simply pass over young children's heads. Essentially all the sex jokes made will not be understood by the younger viewers.<br /><br />Of course the show is not perfect as at it does of course have flaws. But thankfully these flaws are out shined by the brilliance of the series.<br /><br />All I have to say is the biggest mistake in television history was to cancel this show, and put Family Guy back on instead of this. Conversely I am glad there are several more movies coming out which will provide the shows many fans with much more laughs. Overall I give the series a 10. One of the two television series I have ever given this too. The other being the Simpson's."
16797_0,"Recently distributed in DVD, this movie was a disappointment. It takes a unique tact to bring noncombatants into a war film; an idea that should have been a basis for a great story. The missionary doctor and the brave bride hardly get any character development throughout the film. The story is one of a dedicated missionary doctor in the Philippines, who is surprised by the arrival of a former lover. On 6 December, 1941, she has followed the missionary doctor to marry him. He is surprised as he had disregarded the letter, being busy in his research. But, her real love is an Army doctor, currently stationed at Corrigidor. The Japanese attack happens at the close of the wedding ceremony. That begins a 600 miles journey through the jungle, with terribly directed combat scenes and with poorly dramatized suffering. Although we expect some period gloss over suffering and combat, the scenes are very poorly presented. At Corrigidor, the battle progresses, the three friends/lovers are reunited, and the devastating losses mount. I'll leave the ending to the viewer, but it is convincing neither in tone nor emotion. In 1943, there were probably not many technical advisers on the last scenes at Corrigidor, but suffice it to say, the last departees were not leaving on C-47s. I appreciate period pieces, and allow for the oversights, glamorization of the 1940's scripts and productions. And the patriotic message was both expected and deserved by the men and women who struggled on Corrigidor and throughout the Philippines. But, this is just poorly done, and loses all its punch. Too bad for a potentially great story line, in an honestly heroic setting. Having visited Corrigidor, I was hopeful for a powerful, though period based piece. The film was disappointing on all counts."
16841_0,"Jamaica Inn was the last film Alfred Hitchcock made in England before going to Hollywood before the war and from the sloppy look of it he must have been in an awful hurry. A more dreadful Hitch sound film I have yet to see. The cinematography is murky beyond necessity, the editing choppy and telegraphed as the suspense is relegated for the most part to goofy land pirates running amok snarling and terrifying a youthful Maureen O'Hara.<br /><br />A rather odd time and plot (and it shows) for the usually contemporary setting Hitchcock it deals with 18th century pirates that manufacture ship wrecks along the coast of Cornwall. The brains behind the cutthroats who are more caricature than menace is a highly respected landowner, imbalanced perhaps by the ravages of tertiary syphilis (Tabes dorsalis? Then again I'm no doctor). Charles Laughton plays Sir Humphrey Pengallen with a recklessly overreaching almost unintelligible (to fellow actors as well as the audience)disdain for everything as he jabbers incomprehensibly throughout. Laughton seems to act oblivious to all around him and some scenes look more like a rehearsal as he adopts different nuance and utters non-sequiturs as if searching for the right fit. Hitchcock who once referred to actors as cattle clearly has a case of mad cow disease with Laughton. In addition to Hitch's poor handling of the cast (the pirate gang is pure keystone cop dressed in buccaneer) his pacing is off as well with action and suspense scenes lagging and having the imagination of Saturday matinée serials. An incoherent muddle of a film from start to finish featuring two cinema giants at their worst one would be wise to avoid checking in at Jamaica Inn."
16887_0,"The Third Man is a movie that looks and feels not like a movie of the 40s, but like a neo-noir of the late 60s/early 70s. This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.<br /><br />Of all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).<br /><br />The cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns. So The Third Man is not only a wonderful film noir, but a unique look at the brief time between WWII and the height of the Cold War."
16931_0,"Le Libertin, is a French farce about the famous Enlightenment philosopher, Denis Diderot, and his attempts to hide his wickedly atheistic encyclopedia from the church until its completion. This movie is, on the surface, a bawdy, sexy, perverse farce. But beneath this surface, there is more bawd, sex, perversion and farce. But beneath that, there is genuine genius here, the dialogue, humour, acting, eroticism and, most of all, the send-up of the church (it's a shame Islam cannot be so mocked, for Islam now is as insidious as the Church was in the 1700's) is a sheer delight. There is real philosophy here too, not particularly deep, but a millionfold more witty than anything produced by The Matrix movies. 10/10, loved it!"
16977_0,"John Wayne's second effort as star/producer (after ""Angel and the Badman"", in 1947), ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" is a VERY enjoyable tale, set in 1818 Alabama, of coonskin-capped Wayne, part of the Kentucky militia, falling for French immigrant Vera Ralston (in her second film with Duke), and discovering a plot to swindle the French community (composed of ex-officers of Napoleon, and their families) out of their land, by aristocrat John Howard and ruthless river boss Grant Withers.<br /><br />What truly makes this film 'special' for me is Wayne's sidekick, portrayed by the legendary Oliver Hardy, of 'Laurel and Hardy' fame. Hardy, while a friend of Wayne, had only worked 'solo' once in a feature film in over twenty years (1939's ""Zenobia""), and it took a LOT of coaxing (and Stan Laurel's 'blessing'), to get him to accept the role...and what a pleasure he is, to watch! Wayne and Hardy have a rich, warm chemistry, and the rotund comedian, with his infectious smile and Georgia drawl, makes even minor scenes (like swapping recipes with Ralston's mother) a joy.<br /><br />With a first-rate supporting cast including Philip Dorn, Hugo Haas, Wayne 'regulars' Paul Fix, Jack Pennick, and Hank Worden, and Marie Windsor (who looks eerily like John Howard, in my opinion!), ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" is, despite the 'pans' you'll see in some of the reviews posted, one of my favorite John Wayne films...He was never more charming than you'll find him, here!"
17020_0,"Shown at the MIFF as 'The Bridge in the Rain' (why? I dunno).<br /><br />I almost didn't see this film as it sounded as if it could easily have been another of those 'mundane' foreign films but no, it was excellent.<br /><br />Gustav, who originally intended to go to the Tokyo monastery, is the type who gets lost in supermarkets. The other brother, Uwe, ends up going along after drowning his sorrows when his wife leaves him. Unfortunately, Uwe seems to fit right in with the strict monastery life, much to Gustav's torment! He even copes better than his brother when they get lost and separated in Tokyo. They both have personal torment and sibling rivalry which is equally engaging and funny.<br /><br />The monastery is in quiet, idyll surroundings out of Tokyo. A memorable line which hits home if you live in a big city comes in the form of a saying about 'hate' and anger - but I won't give it away.<br /><br />I thought that the story could have gone in any number of possible directions with equally enjoyable results.<br /><br />I also think that filming this on video and using footage from the video camera in the film enhanced the realism. A very memorable film."
17066_0,"""His Girl Friday"" is Howard Hawk's inspired remake of the award-winning Broadway play and previous movie release of ""The Front Page"". It's the story of a rapid fire newspaper editor, Walter (Cary Grant) and his star reporter and ex-wife, Hildie Johnston. Hildie has decided to retire to the country with her soon to be new husband (Ralph Belamy). But when a prison break captures the imagination of a troupe of cutthroat reporters, all rabid for the scoop, Hildie sets aside marital bliss for one last hurrah behind the desk as a cub reporter. <br /><br />THE TRANSFER: BEWARE THIS DVD! There are no less than 12 bootlegged versions of ""His Girl Friday"" circulating through various vendors on DVD. In all but one case the image quality looks as though the entire print had been fed through a meat grinder. <br /><br />The version you want is the one from Columbia Tri-Star Home Video. <br /><br />Its packaging features a disclaimer that reads ""mastered from the original camera negative."" This version of ""His Girl Friday"" exhibits in short  exemplary video quality. The B&W picture has been completely restored. Age related artifacts are nonexistent. The gray scale, black and contrast levels are perfectly realized. Fine detail will astound. There are no digital anomalies. The audio is mono but very nicely cleaned up.<br /><br />EXTRAS: This version also includes some very nice  if all too brief  featurettes on the careers of its stars Rosiland Russell and Cary Grant and the making of the film. There's also the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This girl is worth seeking out!"
17110_0,"This film was a BIG mistake. After the first 2 movies, the fans of ""The Crow"" saga made enough money to put this and the second terrible sequel together. This movie has nothing to do with the originally, brilliant cult movie with Brandon Lee. The story and the actors are so boring and useless that I had to laugh when I saw this crap. The makers they put this together are blind? I don't know who is this director phenomena, but I think he never saw anything about James O Barrs' comic or the first movie. The actor with the name Eric Mobius and his story with the burning scars on his face as a mask are so-so silly. Just try it once, you'll see..."
17156_0,"Simply put...NOT FOR CHILDREN!<br /><br />A lot of anime is somewhat violent and sometimes disturbing but Higurashi is something else! The violence is untamed and brutal. The story is surrounding a little village that is led by 3 families. It all starts when a young boy Keichii moves to the little village from the city in the month of June 1983. He makes friends with 3 girls, Rena, Mion (and later her twin sister Shion), Satoko and Rika. All seems well until he learns the village has a lot of secrets of murder and unexplained deaths. In a series of different chapters (arcs) the story is repeated all based around each character in turn. Each character goes mad and a lot of the time at least one of the group of friends is murdered brutally by one another. The stories explore murder, suspicion and even aliens! <br /><br />It's not something i would recommend to everyone but certainly one I'd recommend to those who don't mind a bit of violence!"
17200_0,"Before all of the present day knucklehead mash of mindless teenage movies, this intelligent, Oscar nominated (for best picture) film shows the last night of summer retreat for a group of young people in a small northern California town, one of whom is about to head back east to attend college. Richard Dreyfuss provides the intelligence, Ron Howard the aloof personality, Paul LeMat the muscle, and Charles Martin Smith the comic relief as the four main players in director George Lucas' first major breakthrough in movies before his adventure with the 'Star Wars' films began in 1977. 'American Graffiti' and 'Star Wars' are the only truly great films that Lucas has been involved with and 'American Graffiti' is shot like a documentary, edited with care, written with charm and performed with excellence by a cast that will always be remembered for this film that helped them launch careers that would take them to the top of their profession."
17246_0,"So I'm relaxing (sobering up) on a fine Sunday morning when what do I see on UPN (latterly CW)? this movie. I wasn't interested in it for the first few minutes, and then I saw Shyamalan's name come up on the credits as writer and director. Like any self-respecting movie connoisseur I grabbed the remote intending to change the channel to any other paid advertisement that would have been more worth my time.<br /><br />Maybe it was laziness, maybe part of me was interested, maybe I felt bad about considering Shyamalan a hack after only watching and not enjoying one and a half movies of his (Sixth Sense and the end of the Village), but I watched it and it was great. Humor? Strong dialogue? Emotion? Utter lack of pseudo-intellectuality? This doesn't sound like Shyamalan!? What the (exp. del.) happened to this guy? M. Night Shyamala tackled a simple and realistic story and it worked, no ghosts, no superheroes, no aliens, no giant porcupines, and no water-nymphs, just a boy going through what boys go through, pure existential crisis (or in another word, ""puberty"") Of course it's also his lowest-rated movie on IMDb (not counting ""Praying with Anger"") which shows you something about the modern world.<br /><br />So, my world was turned on its head. My brother always said ""every good director will make a bad movie, and every once in a while a bad director might make a good movie"" but I never expected something halfway this decent to come from Shyamalan. My new open mind concerning Shyamalan was soon re-shut when I read about his dissatisfaction with the movie and his lack of total freedom with the project. ""Whew, what a relief. I was starting to think you weren't some story-driven, twist-crazed, formulaic egotist and were rather a guy who has trapped himself in his own image. Good to know I can still hate you. Oh, and liking the color red (symbolizing death in this movie, too, don't you know?) doesn't make you a genius or an artist, but making a movie (like this) that doesn't rely on plot twists to sustain the audience's attention, is a step in the right direction."" For every one interested in a good cry, this movie takes some low-blows to get you there, but I'll be darned if they don't do the trick."
17291_0,"""Buying the Cow"" is an extremely well written, highly quotable, overlooked gem of a comedy. Ron Livingston, Ryan Reynolds, and everyone involved must have had a blast making this. If you enjoy the way ""Swingers"" exposes male insecurities, ""Buying the Cow"" is your movie. This is definitely one of the best comedies that no one has ever heard of. After you see ""Buying the Cow"", you will likely be telling your friends, both male and female, that you have discovered comedy gold.

17336_0,"I've been a Texas chainsaw fanatic since i saw the original (when i was about 8) and all the sequels obviously tried hard (except the one with Bridget Jones in which was an utter waste of time) but ultimately failed to be worthy of following up such a classic. the remake was OK, it looked great and had some quality violence but didn't really hit the spot.<br /><br />but when i had finished watching this one (a prequel to a remake?) I've got to say i was very impressed, of course it had problems. the odd character didn't seem to have much of a purpose other than to die horribly and scared teenage girls still have that tendency to walk towards the screams of pain rather than leg it, but the grimness and violence of it all was pretty much relentless. there was no crap attempts at humour (other than the 'sherrif' but thats laughing at how out of order he is) and once it gets going it doesn't stop until the abrupt ending.<br /><br />it looks great, the violence is above and beyond what you expect to see at a cinema (i don't know all the cuts made to the us version but the UK version seems to be about 8mins longer) and it felt like i was watching something that deserved to have 'texas chainsaw massacre' in the title.<br /><br />if you like horror and gore films you should have a great time, go see."
17381_0,"A close friend of mine recommended this movie to me and although it took several days to find it,I finally saw it on NetFlix. Well,let me start by saying I haven't seen so much honesty in a movie since the '70's. What made it special was that it was flawed and uneven,but that's what endeared me even more. Actor John Ford Noonan who played a sort of ""God"" mouthpiece,should of been singled out by Indie crowd as one of the best performances in years,but to my surprise,many people still have not heard of this film,and when I called the IFC channel to complain (I read one of the viewer's rants on the IFC's refusel to play it) They gave me no reasonable excuse,just a simple ""We passed on that title"". Curious,to me. But I think there is an obvious discrimination that reeks around this title."
17426_0,"I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all of the hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (""What if something strange is going on?""...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all. Another thing is that the movie extremely boring. Extremely. Sure, there are a couple of ""jolts"" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. Most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. What was the point of that??<br /><br />To top it off, the movie makes no sense. Yes, I believe I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. Also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. And don't even get me started with the ending. What exactly happened there?<br /><br />I can give Kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. There are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. If they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. But they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. Yes, it's a message movie. Okay, fun. I'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this."

17516_0,"CHE is a triumphant biopic of idealistic proportion. Excellent production and a captivating story loosely based on the man, the legend himself. We may never know how accurate it is historically speaking but both Part I and Part II of CHE prove not only Director Steven Soderbergh's sharp skills in the art of film-making but also Benicio Del Toro's ability to make us believe he is Che Guevara. It deals with whether or not the concepts of war and humanity can live side by side, whether bloodshed can be justified with an act of kindness and what it is that makes a man patriotic. But if I were to compare, I'd say Part I is just slightly above Part II in quality.<br /><br />Part I or formerly known as The Argentine has a long runtime but your curiosity will keep you seated. It's a smart move to have each of the both part of this epic start out with geographical maps of first Cuba, and then South America. It's a known fact that most American audiences are geographically challenged, so this method alone helps. After all, it helps to know which city is where as the story progresses. If Steven Soderbergh had made The Motorcycle Diaries, this could've been like a trilogy saga.<br /><br />We're introduced with a dining scene where doctor Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara first met Fidel Castro. It is obvious from their conversation that the story wants to remind us of how charismatic Fidel Castro is, of how he can influence a doctor into believing that waging a revolutionary war would make a more drastic change rather than simply healing a man in some clinic in the middle of nowhere. We don't know what but something in Che's experience must've caused him to turn from being a doctor into a soldier, something that motivated him to take up Fidel's offer and make that choice.<br /><br />And just like the movie Traffic, Soderbergh has different color for each scene, I think he chose black and white to depict Che's visit to the U.N. so it would go well with the archival footage used in the movie and would add to the sense of authenticity of it all. By the way, I like how the timeline and the pacing are constructed. Che's interview and then we see flashbacks of the revolutionary struggle. Goes back and forth but it doesn't ruin the intensity,.. each is well-positioned, if you will.<br /><br />For the record, those of us who know better, can tell that some of the actors are of different nationalities, from the accent and the looks but I think all of them do a good job of trying to be as convincing as possible. Speaking of which, Benicio Del Toro as Che is perfect, no better actor could pull it off. Is it going to earn him another golden statuette? I doubt it.<br /><br />Those who always think Che was awesome will be happy and those who always think he was nothing but a murderer and assassin will be disappointed because the movie CHE, especially part I really glorifies the man. It makes him seem like a Messiah with weapons. He would kill the Cuban army but at the same time protect the peasants, he would heal the sick, teach the poor how to read and write, give chance for the cowards to leave the group, and execute those on the inside who have abused their power on the weak. The story makes him look like such a saint, I'm surprised it doesn't have him walk on water. The story also has a good amount of comic-relief played by some of the characters within his little army. Some scenes would give the impression like they're just a bunch of guys chillin', havin' some laughs like normal people. In the interview, Che mentions that the ingredient to revolutionary is love,.. Though Fidel's strategy requires groups to be separated into different assignments, we don't know if the others follows Che's code of honor but the focus on Che's people shows a more positive light. The tactics in the final battle in CHE Part I is nothing short of entertaining. Che's self-sacrifice and heroism has paid off. But his origin and his true passion would finally cost him his life."

17606_0,"1st watched 2/13/2007 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Elmer Clifton): Slightly watchable tale about a traveling prostitution circuit that sets up shop wherever it can until the police get a lead. The heads of the group disguise themselves as self-made rich people who somehow just know how to make money. The two heroines in the story, a couple who give links to the local newspaper, are just trying to get on their payroll to make enough money to get married but keep getting caught in the middle of this thing. The hero gets put in jail after the leader of the ring, Mr. Murray(who also happens to be a customer of his girlfriend), plants marked money on him and sends the cops in to arrest him. The rest of the movie, the girlfriend is trying to get him out on bail and is pulled into and introduced to the prostitutes by her boss at the nail saloon(who's doubling as the other leader of the ring). The acting is actually decent in this B movie, but the story is slow to progress and it just doesn't pull you into the plight. The situation just seems a little too canned and Hollywood'ized(as if that we're a word) to have any believability in the characters and their problems. I realize this is a late 30's movie with low production values but the artists don't have enough to make the story worthwhile to watch or credible. Not bad, but definitely could have been better."
17651_0,"The documentary ""Alien: Evolution"" follows the history and production of the wildly successful (well, in the 70's and 80's, anyway) ""Alien"" franchise, and offers quite a bit of amusing and interesting information about the making of the first film, and, to a lesser extent, the sequels made in later years. The show is hosted by Mark Kermode (also of ""On The Edge Of Blade Runner"" fame), who narrates the whole show, and is on hand to give little quips about the production of the films.<br /><br />The documentary primarily deals with the 1979 original masterpiece, and Ridley Scott, Dan O'Bannon, Sigourney Weaver and other participants are on hand to talk about their experiences making the film. Of course, where the real meat is (and is something that wasn't included on the cut version of the doc on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set) concerns the making of Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Granted, all of the participants in the Aliens interviews have nothing but glowing praise for the film, but when you get down to the later entries, people have some surprisingly interesting things to say, including H.R. Giger, who compares the alien suit design in Alien 3 to a piece of excrement, and Lance Henriksen talking about how the third film destroyed all the work that was put into the first two entries, it sheds a whole new perspective on what it was like for the cast and crew to experience these films.<br /><br />It is understandable that Fox would want to cut these offending bits (seeing as how they cut an hour of candid footage of David Fincher out of the Alien 3 Special Edition documentaries), so they recut the film and had it focus on the first movie instead. I don't believe this was a wise move, and I think that if the studio heads have a chance, they should release this documentary in it's original form for everyone to see.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I am giving this a 9 out of 10, because, as it is, the documentaries featured on the Alien Quadrilogy set actually have better in-depth coverage of the same material posted here, but not everything. If you can find it, the documentary airs on television sometimes. Watch it if you get the chance."
17697_0,"Sadsentinelwings , I enjoyed your review. Anyone reading your review who are not consumers of metal, will learn that this topic could easily be discussed and debated on any of those Sunday morning political round-table television shows.<br /><br />That being said, I'm surprised you didn't identify prog metal as a non-metal sub genre. Personally, I love prog metal, especially many of the bands that have emerged from Europe. I hear metal fans (mostly American fans) all the time lament that prog metal isn't true metal. A dark metal fan or power metal fan would claim that prog metal really can't be considered as metal, due to each band member's perspective, motivation, fashion sense and musically elitist attitude; similar to the way that the 70's punks viewed Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Pink Floyd. Personally, I really don't care if its metal or not. Still an interesting discussion.<br /><br />I would have love to see the prog scene explored. Certainly Mike Portnoy or Daniel Gildenlow would have much more to contribute to the discussion than Rob Zombie or Dee Snyder ever could. Besides, all the footage of the concert audience got old. Some of it could have been trimmed and replaced with a discussion of prog metal and how it differs in both positive and negative ways.<br /><br />Though I do agree with you on every criticism, I agree that it is one of the best documentaries I've seen. Certainly far better than any of those metal documentaries on VH1, which are truly horrible."
17741_0,"At first I wasn't sure this movie was going to be much. Prepared to give it a mediocre score, partially to just be nice since it contained work from big names like Robert Redford and Ben Kingsley (who's names didn't appear on the credits on the outside of the package) and more. But this movie did sneak in and grab my attention with it's subtle draw. These people are computer experts, Redfords character is blackmailed because of his past, into doing some work for the government. The task is retrieving a black box, that isn't your run of the mill black box like what is found in air planes, this one has a very powerful secret."
17787_0,"What's the point of this film? What does it have to say? And why does Dyan Cannon disappear so early on? You'll have all those questions running through your mind while you're watching ""Doctor's Wives"", but this vapid, pointless, soap-opera-level film provides no answers. A very superficial treatment of potentially strong subjects. A great cast that is thoroughly wasted. And a heart-surgery scene that is not for the squeamish. (*1/2)"
17831_0,"Mark Twain was a man who sometimes could not get a notion out of his head. He loved the issue of twins and switching births. It pervades much of his fiction, and few seem to comment on it. In one of his early sketches he tells an inquisitive reporter that the tragedy of his life was the strange death of his twin - the boy had one only one mark on his body that differs him from his brother - Twain shows it to the reporter on his own person, and says that was the boy who supposedly died mysteriously and was buried. The reporter leaves after that tidbit.<br /><br />Of course the novel (which became the subject of this film and several others) is the one that people think of as Twain's ""twins switching"" story. It isn't. He would write (in the 1880s) a piece called ""Those Amazing Twins"" about a pair of Italian Siamese twins. The piece (which is not one of his best) became part of the germination that led to his last great Mississippi novel ""Pudd'nhead Wilson"". He separates the twin Italians into two twin brother Italian counts who turn up in the Mississippi town where the action goes. He also takes the ""switched at birth"" motif and uses it in the main story of Chambers the slave switched by his mother Roxey with young Tom Driscoll the wealthy heir. <br /><br />Twins pop up too in ""Tom Sawyer Detective"" - which was based on an old 17th Century Danish murder case involving twins.<br /><br />But it's ""The Prince And The Pauper"" (1876) that is recalled as Twain's ""twin story"". I think it's because the other pieces are minor or (like Wilson) full of other interesting small matters - like the business of the use of fingerprints to settle the mysteries of the plot (a first in 1894). Here it is central to Twain's looking at an appalling, inequitable social system in Tudor England.<br /><br />Henry VIII is dying and his son Edward, Prince of Wales is aware that he is going to soon lose his wise father and take over the reins of government. Of course the truth is he is still too young (in 1547 he is only 11) and he really can only rule in his own right when he reaches adult age (presumably 21). He will need a ""Protector"" and the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Herford are the leading contenders. <br /><br />In the film wise old Henry Stephenson is Norfolk and crafty, power-seeking Claude Rains is Hertford. Henry (Montague Love) appoints both to the governing counsel, but does not name Norfolk over Hertford (or the reverse). So Rains starts jockeying for position in a confrontation with England's premier Duke.<br /><br />In reality it was more complicated. Norfolk was on the outs with Henry in 1547 (he was facing execution - his son the Earl of Surrey was executed the year before - but Henry's own death saved Norfolk). The two contenders were the Duke of Somerset (Edward Seymour), blood uncle to Edward VI through his mother, and John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who dreamed of placing the Dudley family and the Tudors permanently together by marrying the three Tudor heiresses, Princesses Mary and Elizabeth, and Lady Jane Grey, to his sons. One day this plan would blow up in his face (see TUDOR ROSE). Somerset's doom was tied to a similar hair-brained scheme of his brother Admiral Sir Thomas Seymour regarding marrying Princess Elizabeth (see YOUNG BESS). <br /><br />Edward, in Twain's story, while waiting for the sad news, meets Tom Canty, a boy who looks almost exactly like him (here played - for a change - by the Mauch Twins). As a lark they change clothes so each can see how the other half live. Tom is soon over his head, causing his cousin Jane to question his sanity, and revealing enough to Hertford to realize that the false-King is his own key to power. Edward is unfortunately forced to endure the poverty of Tom's social class, but also the brutality of Tom's father John Canty (Barton McLaine) who is a professional thief. But Edward is soon helped by a young squire, Miles Herndon (Errol Flynn) who is trying to return to his ancestral home to regain his possessions from a greedy brother.<br /><br />The twisty plot did show much of the underside of English Tudor living that many of the other early Tudor history films barely touched on (except to show the intrigues at court). It also had plenty of humor - look at the business about the usefulness of ""the Great Seal of England"", which is typical Twain humor. I feel this version of the story is quite good - possibly the best of the different versions of the novel that have reached the screen."
17877_0,"Somewhat of a modern-day ""And Then There Were None,"" as a group of people all meet at a motel, get trapped their in downpour that has blocked roads out of the place......and murders start happening rapidly.<br /><br />Not everyone dies in this movie, however, and there is a very neat twist at the end. The movie keeps your interest all the way but the bad news is that most of the characters are profane and unlikeable, especially the women in here. The ""ladies"" are brutal! <br /><br />John Cusack, as ""Ed,"" has the most interesting role, followed closely by Ray Liotta's ""Rhodes."" Neither of those two characters had last names in this story."
17921_0,"The second installment (well, you don't really expect Balabanov to stop milking this storyline, do you?) in the Brat series is more expensive and it shows. The movie is glitsier and the guns are bigger, as is the body count. Basically, the plot is as simple and formulaic as it gets - an unlikely Russian Duke Nukem Danila Bagrov goes after the killers of his war-time friend. Reunited with his ""brother"" from the original Brat, played by Victor Sukhorukov, Danila runs, shoots and blows up things - now THIS side of the Pond. This is dynamic movie, done much better than most contemporary Russian imports, and is anything but politically correct - be it the mounting body count or the amount of racial slur. In the first movie Bagrov's contempt of the ""dark-skinned"" people was evident in one small episode, in this one he really gets going at - what's the word? - African-Americans :) But unless you are that deep into PC go see this movie - it's like watching somebody really good playing Doom, over his shoulder."
17967_0,"I haven't seen the cartoon of Dennis the menace, but saw the movie as a kid and thought it was good back then,but watching it now i have realized how boring it is. Although, i've always admired the robber, I thought there was wonderful acting shown by Christopher Lloyd. Walter Matthieu was also good, as well as mason gamble. The music played through the movie was good but got a bit monotonous at times. I liked the music played when the bad guy was around. The opening scene was done well with the music and it gave us a good look at the relationship between Dennis and Mr. Wilson. I like how each time something happened he actually didn't mean it to happen."
18010_0,"I admit that I'm biased here. Paul Valentine is a friend I've known since grade school and this video was the first I'd seen of him since 1974. Wow! Paul used to say in school he didn't need math because he was going to be like Elvis - an entertainer. He dreamed of being a rock star and movie star and what do you know? Here he was headlining a Paramount Pictures video! I admit that as a Christian I was taken aback at first but the little boy I first met in second grade was there for all too see. I rapidly came to understand what Paul was presenting. He no more worshipped the devil than I do but he knew a potentially successful schtick when he saw it; a schtick he readily admits to having parlayed into 24 years of personal appearances, a mammoth ""satanic"" church, and hundreds of YouTube videos and BlogTalkRadio shows. Good job, Paul!<br /><br />But I don't believe for a second you're a satanist."

18100_0,"*Spoilers* This is the (fictional) account of Vitus von Holzen, a piano prodigy. In the first third of the movie Vitus is six years old and in the rest he is twelve. The main stroke of brilliance this film has to offer is in the casting of two piano prodigies to play Vitus. Teo Georghiu plays Vitus at age twelve, he was about twelve at the time of the filming and is stunningly talented. <br /><br />Most people are captivated by genius no matter what the area of expertise, and genius in a young person is particularly fascinating. It seems that the main areas open to childhood prodigies are chess, music, and mathematics and it is not uncommon for a genius in one of these areas to have talents in the others. If you have ever attempted to excel in any area and encounter a person who is so above and beyond what is normally considered excellence, then your appreciation for such a person is heightened. Teo Gheorhiu commands such esteem. By far the high points of the movie for me were in seeing him play and marveling at his ability.<br /><br />Vitus faces a decision that I assume most prodigies face, and that is how much of their lives should be devoted to developing their gift. To rise to the top, the devotion required would be pretty much all-consuming, or at least it would set them apart from a more normal childhood. Vitus faces such a decision, a decision accentuated by the pressures of his parents to capitalize on his gift and the mockery of his fellow students, since he excels in the classroom as well. It seems that the only person who simply wants Vitus to find his own way is his grandfather (Bruno Ganz in a fine performance), and Vitus establishes a close bond with him.<br /><br />The internal conflict Vitus faces between conforming and pursuing his talent is set up nicely. In order to fit in, Vitus fakes a diminution of ability after an attempt to put on wings and jump from the second story of his house results in a concussion. It was not clear to me if Vitus purposely staged this event so that he could subsequently fake normalcy, or if he just recognized the possibilities the accident afforded him. But no matter how hard Vitus tries to be an average kid, like buying popular music CDs, his interest in classical music cannot be suppressed and he buys a CD of Bach's Goldberg Variations played by Alexey Botvinov that excites him to try his own playing on his grandfather's piano. Only his grandfather knows that Vitus' talent is still there and Vitus is faking its lack.<br /><br />This is a great setup for a rich final payoff that is totally squandered in the final third where Vitus starts playing the stock market in order to save his father's job. Due to insider information he makes millions and winds up buying a NASA-sized flight simulator for his aviation loving grandfather. When I saw that thing in Vitus' grandfather's shop, I knew the movie had taken a regrettable wrong turn into fantasy land. For one thing Vitus would have been slapped with an insider trading lawsuit fairly quickly. As he continued to make more millions and bought out his dad's old company, I lost respect for this movie.<br /><br />In addition to being a piano prodigy, Georghiu is a good actor with a winning personality. Based on the brief interview with him on the DVD extras it would appear that Georghiu has not been tortured by life decision conflicts. He says he wants to play a concert in the Royal Albert Hall by the time he is twenty and also remarks that in order to make a lot of money you have to be really good. I hope he achieves both of those goals.<br /><br />For a movie that treats the same themes (but chess instead of pianism) see ""Searching for Bobby Fischer."" That film stays grounded, perhaps because it is based on a true story."
18146_0,"Takva - A Man's Fear of God is one of those films that playfully enact conflicts of fundamental importance for the world we live in. Takva starts off with humble Muharrem, an introverted single man living in Istanbul, being drawn into the inner circle of a Muslim brotherhood he has adhered to ever since his childhood days. When the erudite and strikingly pragmatic leader, Sheikh Cemal, appoints him as his financial organizer, Muharrem gets endowed with all the amenities and trappings of a modern world businessman. He has to collect rent and administer the order's finances. His naive will to live a life according to what he thinks is the will of God clashes not only with his unfulfilled sexual desires, but also with the mechanisms of power within the order. The brothers' lifestyle may be conservative, but they run an organization that is fully intertwined with the present day social, political and economic life of Turkey. <br /><br />For Muharrem, who hardly understands any of this business, this means that every step he intends to make for the greater glory of God draws him ever deeper into the quagmire of corruption, lies and hypocrisy. The authority he is endowed with now makes him haughty and difficult to deal with, while his accumulated frustration increasingly throws him into literal fits. Everything escalates when he comes face to face with the woman he desires... <br /><br />The plot for this great film is based on an old folk tale from Turkey about a man who refuses to marry the daughter of his spiritual master although he clearly loves her. In Onder Cakar and Omer Kiziltan's adaptation, the narrative serves to expose the inner mechanisms of puritan Muslim orders and throw light on the mental set-up of its loyal members. The film is pure fun to watch due to countless instances of great irony, a remarkable love for detail and breathtaking scenes of ecstatic rituals. While the filmmakers were very careful not to ridicule the milieu they're depicting, their critical approach accounts for a film that substantially helps understand the way political Islam ""works""."
18191_0,"I must say I just finished watching this movie, and what a waste. I agree this movie had some great actors (Ray Liotta), and a decent plot. However, I lost interest in this movie after a while and was just waiting for it to end, and did not really care how it ended. The usual suspects ripoff was evident in that there was a crime lord, in this case a Danny Ludden, as compared to the Kaiser Sosa of Usual Suspects who nobody had ever really seen. Yeah right. This movie tried to tell us that the Danny Ludden character owned property all over ""the city"", which they slipped and called Detriot once, and controlled a gang that ran Detroit, and no one had ever seen him. Wow, this is an amazing concept. Meanwhile the Assistant DA who Ray Liotta is banging is intertwined within the movie as a rape suspect/murder suspect who is thought to be black, but is really white. Is the viewer to believe that in this day in age in the US there can be an Assistant DA in a city like Detroit who is using a false identity and no one catches this? Oh well, don't waste your time, watch the Usual Suspects for a decent movie with a good plot."
18236_0,"I loved Battlestar Galactica when I was a kid. I never saw the series, but the two movies were really nice work.<br /><br />And today, I still love those two movies, but can understand the bad reputation the series gained.<br /><br />But I love the scenario (it is so wonderfully hopeless: The last remnants of a human civilisation are fleeing the overwhelmingly evil Cylon empire). It has some very strong moments, for example when the treason of the Cylons is discovered too late to save the human colonies and fleet. This was a bold and different approach. Or when Apollo's brother is shot down and killed just seconds before reaching the safe haven Galactica.<br /><br />I love the spaceships. The model kits are really wonderful, especially the Battlestar design.<br /><br />And I also love the characters. Starbuck impersonates everything a boy wants to be (he's so damn cool), and I still go by the codename Starbuck today, though (or maybe because) I am totally different. Lorne Greene as Adama is the archetype of the wise leader, and the girls might seem very 70s to us today, but they certainly worked back then :-)<br /><br />All in all, I think that Battlestar Galactica, at least the movie, deserves some better praise than that you usually hear. Even though the battle sequences are always the same (they always get the Cylon in the middle, njahahaha)...<br /><br />And yes, I hate the kid and the robot-dog as well."

I laughed hysterically when Brett Michaels from the band Poison had a guest appearance! And everyone will wet their pants when seeing the episode where Chris dates a female police officer who is CRAZY! All surrounded by great music. I was also surprised by the humor of drummer Kenny!

My favorite one is the one where Elyse's (Meredith Baxter Birney) brother, Ned (Tom Hanks), comes to town. You'll have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how any why. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. I also loved the theme song. It's called ""Without Us,"" and it's performed by Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams. Before I wrap this up, I hope that all you die-hard fans of the show will always have it live on in syndication. In conclusion, even though it can also be seen on Nick at Nite now, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good."

Ridiculously laughable story, hammy, bad acting, sub par music, zero chemistry between the two romantic leads, sticky sweet, implausible plot are only a few of the ways I can describe this incredibly bad movie. Robin Williams certainly did nothing for his career with this flop, and he really needs a hit movie badly. This movie is terrible on every conceivable level and it makes me wonder how thinking people could come up with a dud like this one. The fact that some people liked this movie only confirms how stupid the average American is becoming! It's no wonder it went to video so quickly!"

18506_0,"Filmed in glorious black and white, MAN OF THE CENTURY (MotC) is a funny, charming spoof of and tribute to the films of the 1920s and '30s, in which our Roaring Twenties hero, good-natured joe Johnny Twennies (stage actor Gibson Frazier in a chipper, endearing performance. He also co-wrote and co-produced this daft little gem with Adam Abraham) just happens to be living in late 1990s Manhattan. Zany fish-out-of-water hijinks, adventures (Johnny's a newspaper reporter covering a hot crime-and-corruption story, don'cha know), and snappy musical numbers ensue. MotC is a short one-joke movie (a little under 80 minutes), but the joke is put across delightfully, often reminding me of early Woody Allen movies (including the style of the end credits). The darndest people turn up in the cast, too, such as Frank Gorshin, Anne Jackson (billed as Madame du Froid, for some reason), PRODUCERS Tony-winner Gary Beach, Susan Egan (our household has loved Egan and her brightly sultry voice since we heard her cartoon voice work in Disney's HERCULES, among others), bandleader Lester Lanin, and Bobby Short, the swankiest saloon singer The Big Apple ever saw (yes, he's involved in at least one of the musical numbers :-)). There's even a sequence paying homage to the Expressionism style of film-making. I've seen MotC on the IFC Channel, but it's also available from Netflix, so I highly recommend you renting or even buying it. This flicker's tops, and that's no banana oil! :-)"
18551_0,"(Slight Spoilers) Running neck and neck with the ridicules ""Exorcist II: the Hieratic"" as the worst movie of 1977 ""The Chiorboys"" is about the most off-the-wall cop movie ever made that was so bad that even the book's author Joseph Wambaugh,that the movie is based on, disowned it never wanting to be mentioned in the same breath with the film.<br /><br />Having a bunch of beer and booze guzzling as well as mentally unstable LA police officers make complete fools of themselves is not very funny as the movie want's it's audience to think. These yo-yo's end up causing more trouble to the community as well as themselves then any gang of street thugs could possibly do and were supposed to like them? There are a number of cops who have very serious mental hang-ups that leads to suicide and in the case of police officer Sam Lyles, Don Stroud, involuntary manslaughter but what that shows is how lax the LAPD is in allowing men with serious mental problems into it ranks.<br /><br />The cops in the movie ""The Chiorboys"" screw up almost ever assignment that their put on but what get's them in trouble is when Lyles, drunk and locked up in a police paddy wagon, goes wacko and blows away a park hustler when he tried to help him. Were shown at the beginning of the movie that Lyles has been suffering from a sever case of claustrophobia since he was in Vietnam but yet he managed to get into the LAPD where, being assigned a deadly weapon, he may very well be put in tight places where his phobia would take over his common sense.<br /><br />There's also the sad case of officer Baxter Slate, Perry King, who's suffering from very dark sexual hangups dealing with S&M that leads him to get involved with a dominatrix. When discovered getting his rocks off by his fellow cops Baxter begs them for help, all Baxter wanted was for them to talk to him, but is ignored which leads to him, feeling ashamed and abundant, shooting himself.<br /><br />With these two cases of police driven to he edge and beyond it's very hard to find anything funny in the movie that's supposed to be a police comedy/drama about the inner workings of the LAPD. Remarkably the most touching and understanding scene in the movie has to do with the uncouth and scuzzy head of the vice squad Sgt. Scuzzi, Burt Young. Talking to a young man picked up for soliciting in the park Sgt. Scuzzi takes the time to talk to him and treats the frightened 18 year-old with kindness and understanding like a father not a hardened cop on the beat. It turned out that Scuzzi letting the boy off without being booked didn't end his problems with him getting shot and killed later in the movie.<br /><br />Very uneven at best and mindless and offensive, to every race color and creed, at worse ""The Chiorboys"" totally misses the mark that it, and author Joseph Wambaugh in his book, tried to make about the pressures of being a policeman in a major US city. We get a bunch of stories of cops who are so unstable and unprofessional that they come across worse then any of the criminals in the movie and end up getting the worse of it when their ever called upon to arrest or restrain them. There's even a very disturbing scene when two of the cops Rules & Proust, Tim Mcintire & Randy Quaid, are on a roof trying to stop a woman from jumping to her death. Rules encourages instead of trying to talk her out of it where she ends up jumping to her death.<br /><br />The very contrive ending with officer Whalen, Charles Durning, confronting his boss Chief Deputy Riggs, Robert Webber, about him suspending some half-dozen officers, involved in the cover-up of the Lyles shooting was about as corny and unconvincing as it could get. That was supposed to be the high point in the movie that would make you forget just how silly and hare-brained it was up until then. Instead of making the movie ""The Chiorboys"" better it made it even worse if that at all was possible."

18641_0,"Can art transform life? If so, I would elect ""The Best of Youth"" as a primary candidate for that possibility.<br /><br />Almost never in my over 60 years of film viewing have I been as deeply affected, haunted by characterizations, poetic dialog and brilliantly unexpected turns...and breadth of scope. The nuances of relationship between people...in this case the Italian family Carati, their lovers, friends, wards...are so moving, so deeply portrayed and inhabited by the actors that I was not only moved to tears, but inspired. Here is a view of how human beings can live the humanity so desperately needed in this crazed and warring world...also presented as an integral part of plot and interaction...and this done without any sort of didactic or polemic foisting...All achieved through the intimate and profound struggles of the film's characters.<br /><br />Imagination and the incredible sensibility of director (Marco Tullio Giordana),writers (Petraglia and Rulli) and actors (most outstanding: Luigi LoCacio, Alessio Boni, Adriana Asti and Jasmine Trinca) combine to offer a film that carried this participant (for that's what I felt) into a realm only experienced by exceptional literature.<br /><br />As is obvious...I highly recommend seeing this movie."
18687_0,"This movie has the blessing of the flawless direction of Richard Eyre, who knows a lot about kings and queens. The screen play is adapted by the author of the play, Jeffrey Hatcher. Surprisingly, these two men have been able to create a film that is not only visually satisfying, but it also is an adult entertainment.<br /><br />This movie gives us a glimpse of how theatre functioned in England up to the times of Charles II. The female roles of all plays were portrayed by male actors. The school of acting in that era was an artificial one where actors relied in gestures and affectations that would be laughable today in a serious drama, but that was the way it was the accepted Method then, nothing to do with Stanivslaski, or Strassberg.<br /><br />The leading figure of that theatrical world was Ned Keynaston, who was the most famous Desdemona of his time. There must have been a lot of gay men that were attracted to that world, as was the case with Mr. Keynaston, who might have been bisexual, although that comes as a secondary subplot. This actor is greatly admired by all, including the dressing assistant, Maria. This girl loved to be in the theatre, but could not, because only men were allowed. So instead, she goes to a second rate company that puts on plays in a pub and emerges as Margaret Hughes, an actress in her own right who will challenge Keynaston's Desdemona and makes that role, her signature role as well.<br /><br />Claire Danes, as Maria, or Margaret Hughes, has never been better! She shines as the girl whose ambition is to be on stage. She is wonderful in the part. Ned, played with gusto by Billy Crudup, shows an unexpected range, although he has done theatre extensively. Both of these actors takes us back to London and make us believe that what we are watching.<br /><br />A glorious English cast behind the two American principals are gathered to play effortlessly the theatrical figures of the time, and also the King and his court. Ruper Everett, as King Charles II, is hilarious. The scene in which he plays in drag with his mistress, Nell Gwynn, is one of the best things of the movie. Also, Richard Griffith, as lecherous Sir Charles Sedley, gives a stellar performance. Ben Chaplin, as the Duke of Buckingham, reveals the ambiguity of the men that were attracted to those early thespians. <br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable because of Richard Eyre's direction and eye for detail."
18731_0,"This was the greatest science fiction film ever made. It had everything from half naked cave women (who look like strippers) to giant dinosaur puppets that our hero, the brain damaged surfer, must battle to save the planet (only to set off an atomic bomb accidentally at the end of the movie).<br /><br />Star Wars won an academy award for special effects and it only had 1 Darth Vader. Well, this movie has like 50. You know it was a conspiracy at the academy awards. This movie should have cleaned house.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie that is almost as bad as being a virgin. You have really missed something wonderful and unique that all human beings should experience.<br /><br />If everyone watched this movie there would be no famine or war, and the ozone layer would grow back."
18777_0,"This film was to be Dirty Harry's last outing in the seventies (do not worry though, he had two comebacks in the eighties). It is easy to compare this film, with the two previous Dirty Harry movies, because there some things have (still) not changed. First of all, Harry (obviously) kept his cheeky mouth, which again provides the viewer with the necessary laughs and his boss with the necessary headaches. This is not the only thing that has stayed the same though. Again some of the scenes could have been shorter, thus (theoretically) making The Enforcer a much tighter package. A perfect example of that is the scene in which Harry chases a bad guy to the rooftop of a building. Not only could this scene have been shorter, but it could also have been much more exciting had there been adequate use of music and cinematography. There is however one upside to this installment in the Dirty Harry series, which is, that it is far more stable than it's predecessors. It is not a decent or good film film, but it gets very close, mainly because of the good acting and the fact that the film remained interesting for the despite it's downsides. Best Dirty Harry film until then. If you want to know if it is the best in the series, check my comment for Sudden Impact.<br /><br />6,5 out of 10"
18821_0,"This splendid comedy is the one about the wife 'who comes back from the dead' only to find her husband, just that morning, remarried. Of course, she was never dead in the first place but stranded on a desert island with a hunky athlete as her only companion. The resulting complications are the stuff of a classic screwball farce and when the husband is Cary Grant and the wife is Irene Dunne and the writers are Sam and Bella Spewack you know you have a winner on your hands.<br /><br />Bits of this movie have found their way into homages to the genre over the years and the whole thing was remade in 1963 as a vehicle for Doris Day and with considerably less zing. Leo McCarey, who directed Grant and Dunne in ""The Awful Truth"", (and won an Oscar for doing so), acts as producer here, leaving the direction to Garson Kanin who makes a very fine job of it. The supporting cast are pretty top-notch as well, with terrific cameos from Donald Mc Bride as an hotel clerk and Granville Bates as a somewhat bewildered judge. Even the children can act in this one and aren't in the least obnoxious in the way of most American moppets of the period."
18867_0,"One thing, i'm sure about, that there was another policeman who didn't die yet, (the one with the white barb). But why he doesn't worried about his partners (or his friend/ father of the victim) who obviously never showed up again ???? Or maybe looking for a help ??? (I always hopping that in the middle of the film, there were a S.W.A.T team who came from no where) I always like a horror/gore movies, but i like betters ones with some logic behind it. I think Rob Zombie miss about this one. We can only suppose that, Mr Policeman is a member of this freak family, or he doesn't really care about his partners, or maybe he's got sick and die ...<br /><br />Rob Zombie shame on you :p"
18911_0,"A down-trodden girl, a mutt dog, and a criminal fugitive on the run. Sounds a lot like 1941's High Sierra, even down to lead actress Ida Lupino. But it doesn't matter that these elements got recycled, because Deep Valley is a really watchable 90 minutes of Hollywood melodrama. Sure, it's hokey at times, especially the weepy ending that's squeezed for all its worth. But the movie is also a testimonial to the demandingly high standards of Hollywood studio production-- scope out the great farm house that almost looks like Katrina hit it, and the road project that looks so real, I expect it was. There's also the exquisite b&w photography from cameraman Ted Mc Cord, along with expert direction from studio ace Jean Negulesco. But most of all, it's the absolutely luminous performance from Lupino in the central role. Was there anyone ever better at playing soulful parts. Here, her stuttering, long-suffering farm girl whose only joy is her dog and the great outdoors, is enough to move the Rock of Gibraltar, and is surely Oscar-worthy. Speaking of the outdoors, it's also a measure of the film's underlying romanticism that the lovers seek refuge in the liberating openness of nature, and away from the blessings of civilization. For each has been brutalized by societal forces larger than themselves. Dane Clark is very good too, even if he never got past second fiddle to John Garfield-- then too, his strictly blue-collar personality was a poor fit for the upwardly mobile 1950's, and by that white-collar decade, he was gone. Anyhow, this super-slick film again demonstrates how wonderfully vital B-pictures of the studio era could be, and is well worth a look see."
18957_0,"I thought this was a well-made film by a director of integrity about another director of integrity. It showed the devastating effects of HUAC witch-hunts on the careers and families of brilliant filmmakers in Hollywood, during the late '40s and early '50s. It exposed the split between those who were able to withstand the crass interrogations and those who failed. It was possible to identify with the tragedy of those who were jailed and feel joy when they found a way of escaping from their victimization. I attended a showing of the film with the director answering questions about his film. I was struck by his humility and empathy.<br /><br />"
19000_0,"What a disappointment. ""The Flesh and the Fiends"" has a lot going for it, including a cast of familiar genre faces (Peter Cushing, Donald Pleasence, and Billie Whitelaw), decent production values, and a distinctly eerie atmosphere. Unfortunately, the story of an anatomy professor (Cushing) who uses fresh corpses brought in (and often killed) by two bums (including a pre-bald Pleasence) plays more as a straight drama than a horror film; there would be nothing wrong with this if the story had a hint of interest, but it doesn't. Stripping away the credentials of the cast, the film itself is slow, talky, and generally uninteresting. Sort of like an AIP film without the cheese, and a Hammer film without the fine polish."
19046_0,"Serial Mom is an absolute gem of a movie. Turner's acting is truly excellant, as is the whole casts. Although a little ridiculous at first, any flaws it has are made up for in the way Beverley carries out her murders, my favourite being the guy in the toilets gruesome demise."
19091_0,"the only thing I still remember of the movie is the stupid pentagram that looks like a Christmas decoration(somebody already wrote about it, I know). Ah, the good accent of foreign guys when speaking Italian: Hopkins was ridiculous when reciting in Latin-Italian in Hannibal. Maybe that was the only aspect they concentrated on while doing this movie and still I don't understand this etruscan book idea where it came from. For what I remember the etruscan civilization was many years before Rome itself was founded and was conquered by Romans before the coming of Christ. So why this weird link. If there's some good history teacher, please help me solve the question. At the moment I left all of my elementary school books in Italy"
19136_0,"Although a source of much embarrassment (and biographical revisionism) to Paul Robeson in later years, by the standards of its day Sanders of the River isn't quite as obnoxiously racist as you might think. Unlike American films of the period, it's more patronising than openly defamatory and while he's hardly a role model, Robeson's convict-turned-king plays a more central role in the plot than Leslie Banks condescendingly paternalistic British commissioner (""Sandi the Brave, Sandi the Wise/Righter of Wrongs, Hater of Lies!""). But then, you don't expect subtlety from a story by Edgar Wallace, who many blamed for the collapse of peace talks during the Boer War because of his salacious invented newspaper stories of Boer atrocities.<br /><br />As a film it holds together fairly well, with the extensive and often spectacular location footage of Africa and Shepperton riverside (all too obviously shot with stand-ins for the two stars) compensating for the Victor Herbert operetta style songs given to Robeson (""Let the rivers rattle/Onwards into battle/Make them flee like cattle"")."
19181_0,"Dead Poets Society is a thoroughly moving, and inspiring film from Peter Weir, who is definitely one of the most under rated directors around. This movie is in the same vein as ""A Separate Peace"", in the sense of setting, and in the general coming of age story line. The basic message is to ""suck the marrow out of life"", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest. It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion. This is a must see."
19226_0,"Literally one of the darkest of noir films, though not everyone's favorite it seems.<br /><br />THE ENFORCER is criticized in several comments posted on IMDb in part for its portraying cops learning code words such as ""hit"" and ""contract"", for the first time.<br /><br />The words are a minor springboard device which aren't crucial to the evidence. Eye-witness testimony is what the cops badly need to put the top man in the chair.<br /><br />The historical context loosely linking the plot to Murder, Inc. hardly diminishes the ability of the film to hold up as an edgy crime suspense drama some 55 years later. <br /><br />It's a movie with a great ensemble cast of character actors relishing the juicy dialog.<br /><br />Of course viewers today aren't going to drop their jaws over the cinematic debut of words that have long since become common in the colloquial lexicon.<br /><br />Especially when there are plenty of great lines in the film to enjoy, and even mimic over and over again:<br /><br />Such as Ted De Corsia's ""He ain't human!"", ""I gotta get-out-of-here!"" and ""You know what to use. Use it!""<br /><br />And the meeting between the #1 man and his #2 man, whose repartee enriched with sinister gestures is well worth rediscovering:<br /><br />Mendoza- ""I've been worked over by some of the best, and you're just what I'm looking for."" Rico -""What? You want some more?"" Mendoza - ""I can use a guy like you!""<br /><br />Rico - ""You must be nuts!"" Mendoza - ""I've still got a dime left. C'mon, I'll buy you a cup of coffee!""<br /><br />Mendoza - ""Someday you'll realize I'm a great man. I'll make you a rich man."" Rico - ""I must have kicked you in the head!""<br /><br />Mendoza - ""This is my first contract. I'm getting paid $500 for the hit."" Rico - ""You'll never have $500 as long as you live!""<br /><br />My favorite shock scene is when a hit man realizes he's about to be ""taken care of"" by an old crony, he makes a desperate break for it into the night, letting out a blood-curdling scream.<br /><br />THE ENFORCER is not presented as a bio or semi-documentary at all, really. There is no narration, no final moral. Bogey doesn't indirectly lecture the viewers, instead he's picking his own brain as Ferguson. <br /><br />Though he's a dedicated lawman, Bogey's not playing a preachy reformer as did John McIntire (Police Commissioner Hardy), quite admirably to be sure, in the 1950 John Huston crime caper classic, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE. <br /><br />ASPHALT JUNGLE and FORCE OF EVIL are also films with scenes of double-crosses and back- stabbing that I enjoy as much as THE ENFORCER.<br /><br />Relentlessly grim, and for the most part original, THE ENFORCER stands on it's own.<br /><br />The ending is a bit anti-climatic only because it wraps up so quickly after all the tension and flashbacks have reached the anticipated moment of the ""pay-off"", so I rate it a 9 out of 10. <br /><br />I had no problem with the way the story unfolds as we are given pieces of the puzzle. The flashbacks get better and better so my advice is stick with it. <br /><br />Underrated gem, deserving better than the reserved reviews and short shrift it often gets.<br /><br />Zero Mostel, Everett Sloane, Ted De Corsia, Jack Lambert etc. all contribute what are perhaps among their best, if brief, performances on film,<br /><br />TWO ICE-PICKS, WAY UP!"
19271_0,"This film seemed to run at high speed, but it made the action more hilarious! Mae Murray was the real star, as in this case her eccentricity worked! She plays a poor shop girl impersonating a show girl. She whirls around like a dervish and struts like a diva! It was funny how she presented herself as a Mary Pickford look alike! Over the top works for comedies,wish she had done more of the genre! Poor Rudy had little to do except look beautiful though! But I'm not complaining! I know this was an early effort for him.I guess he and Mae remained friends as he was best man at one of her weddings! This is a cute little rarity, and Mae is a hoot!

19316_0,"Just like Asylum's version of War Of The Worlds, this film has the following characteristics:<br /><br />- Poor acting - Bad effects - Continuity errors all over the place - A few 'glowing reviews' that cannot possibly be real - Timed to coincide with the release of a similar big-budget movie<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes I had to stop watching it, else my foot would have gone through the screen.<br /><br />It's not the few dollars that I paid to rent this rubbish, but the fact that I feel cheated once again.<br /><br />Remember the name: 'Asylum' - the movie company to avoid."
19361_0,"Okay. First, in all honesty I must point out that I usually prefer the movies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, but I have watched quite a few Chaplin films recently. While this film isn't quite as good as a few of his later films (such as City Lights), this is still a good film and very lovely to watch--with a real artistic touch by writer/director/director/musical score creator and actor Chaplin is truly outstanding!! He at least deserves a lot of praise for being so versatile.<br /><br />So, despite its beauty why do I only give it a 7? Well, aside from some very funny slapstick moments, there is, once again, a lot of ""schmaltzy"" moments and the film is jam-packed with pathos. In other words, the movie tries VERY VERY VERY hard to be poignant and touching--and I am the type of person that prefers a little more humor and a little less of the sappy hero. I know this ISN'T the opinion of everyone--so if you LIKE when he tugs at your heartstrings and helps a damsel in distress (yet again), then you'll be thrilled. I just thought I'd seen this theme one time too many.<br /><br />BY THE WAY--Chaplin was well-known for being very obsessive-compulsive about his films--doing scenes again and again to get it ""just right"". Well, he made a big blunder here and I was surprised it wasn't caught. While doing the very funny high-wire act, his right pant leg came off while he was holding on to the pole for balance and monkeys were climbing all on and around him. Then, when the shot cut back, the pants leg was back ON!! Oops. This doesn't spoil the movie at all--it's just a funny little mistake. Or, maybe, one of the cute monkeys crawling all over him during this scene put his pants leg back on him!<br /><br />PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies. After each one, my appreciation for his talents increased. In hindsight, I think a score of 8 is more in order. While it's true I'm not much for pathos, I must acknowledge his amazing talents."
19406_0,"The character played by Anthony Hopkins tells a story in the film to Ryan Gosling. The story is about sorting eggs on a farm when he was a boy and about putting aside 300 eggs that all had minute cracks or imperfections. The moral is that everything has a weakness if you look closely enough. Hopkins is using the story to warn Gosling that his near perfect conviction record is about to be tested like never before.<br /><br />I caught an advance screening of 'Fracture' and am counting myself among the lucky. 'Fracture' showcases two terrific performances. The first is Ryan Gosling who plays a hot shot Assistant District Attorney on the verge of joining a very lucrative private law firm. He's only got one case left to handle and, although it looks like a slam dunk on paper, he'll soon find it to be a bit more formidable than he first thought.<br /><br />The second great performance is Sir Anthony Hopkins. Stealing every scene he's in with charm, humour and menace, Hopkins turns in one of his most enjoyable performances of recent years. Hopkins plays the accused in Gosling's last case and goes out of his way to give Gosling a very bad day. The battle of wills between the two leads is central to the movie and their combat is electrifying.<br /><br />One of the main questions in the movie is the location of the murder weapon. The film quite explicitly shows the crime of the film and how it is carried out in the first ten minutes of the movie. It seemed obvious to me where the gun was (although my friends told me after the film they had no idea). For my part, knowing where the gun was didn't hurt the film at all because although Gosling's battle to solve the case and get a conviction are certainly a core part of the film, 'Fracture' works better as a character study. Both leads are over-flowing with pride. Both believe themselves to be as flawless as the eggs from the story are supposed to be, but both will come to realize that they have micro-fractures too. This movie is about their arrogance and ultimately about how they deal with the discovery that perfection is a little more elusive than they thought. 'Fracture' shows all seven deadly sins at work and places Pride as the deadliest -- all else springs from it.<br /><br />'Fracture' has a great score, a terrific script and dynamic characters who are believable in everything they do. This is a rich and highly enjoyable film. I fear it might get lost in the shadow of huge summer blockbusters like Spiderman 3 which is really a shame -- totally engaging little gems like this are why I love movies. 'Fracture' is well worth your time and the price of admission."
19451_0,"Elfen Lied is presented as a series of 13+1 24 minutes episodes. Although the plot is not new (mutants that have enough power to exterminate the whole human race) the characters and the story flow are fresh and most of all very surprising. The main character is a diclonius (two-horned human) named Luci / Nyu and she have a special ability called vectors (invisible extra strong energy hands). The main plot follows the usual formula boy takes innocent girl in, falls in love with her, but there are also any complex character dilemmas. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this anime because of the gore, blood and nudity content. But I guess it all works toward the strange horror-comedy experience. Who would've ever guessed that an innocent looking, pink-haired girl would be capable of causing such a major blood bath? You see heads being ripped off, bodies torn in half, and blood dripping everywhere. Once again if you are not comfortable with this kind of scenes, then is likely that Elfen Lied is not for you. If you liked anime like: Akira, Blood: The Last Vampire and Evangelion, you might have some fun with Elfen Lied. Perhaps, the animation is nothing out of the ordinary and if compared with the manga version it is a little bit short and the extra episode 14 does not help toward the end (is more like a retrospective episode in between 7th and 8th episode).

19497_0,"Benny Hill was a true comedy great, evident in this fitting tribute of him, shown here as a compilation of his very best shorts. His comedy is admittedly quite bawdy, as Benny makes men look like idiots and lectures mangling the English language, but I like bawdy and particularly it suits Benny to a tee. The quality is a little grainy and washed out, but the shorts are still a lot of fun, Tuppertime especially is priceless particularly with the vicar who comes on the air with his flies undone, and Benny is as wonderful as ever. Jackie Wright and Bob Todd do their usual selfless stooging to perfection, and Patricia Hayes is delightful in her appearances. The scripting is also top notch and the music is well done. Overall, I truly enjoyed myself, a really nice 83 or so minutes to spend your afternoon. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
19541_0,"Coming out at the same time as Ken Russell's rather more amusing Valentino, The World's Greatest Lover suffers from Gene Wilder's sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for the side-splitting. Thus we get the odd huge close-up of mouths covered in shaving foam and a lot of tiresome hysteria and tongues. We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock, for which we can at least be grateful. Unfortunately, we get much more of Wilder's tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical  when in doubt, shout seems to be his motto  with Wilder adding a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets nervous. And he gets nervous a lot. Be still my aching ribs It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing. Wilder does acknowledge the debt in a screen credit that's part thank you to 'my friend', but seems more name-dropping in a film that comes across as something of a vanity project  certainly with Wilder starring, writing, directing, producing and even writing a song for the film, it's fair to say where the buck stops on this one. One of those films that at once offers fairly lavish period production design but often a complete lack of understanding of silent cinema  yes, we do get sped-up comedy scenes - it's definitely pre-Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood, which completely destroyed most of the then-common myths about silent cinema that this embraces. Indeed, anachronisms abound, with the feel (and the songs) often more Thirties than Twenties, which perhaps wouldn't matter quite so much if it were all funnier. It's not a total disaster  there's the odd good line (a conductor announcing ""Hollywood, home of the stars and several featured players""), a nicely natural performance from Carol Kane before she became a mess of mannerisms to rival Wilder and it does offer a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see James Hong playing a Norwegian (or is it Svedish?) studio executive, complete with excellent accent. (Also to be glimpsed among the bit parts in the supporting cast are Danny De Vito as an assistant director, Billy Sands  Paparelli in Sergeant Bilko  as a studio guard and, as the boss of a bakery, David Huddleston, here billed as 'Michael Huddleston's Father'!)"
19587_0,"This is both awe-inspiring and goofy at the same time, when Senator Bulworth, tired of what he's doing, suddenly decides to speak the truth to voters. It's all about big money and they mean nothing. At first it's not well received but then apparently folks decide that they like it, too bad he's put a hit out on himself to end it all though and the guy that arranged all that has a heart attack before he can call off the hit. This is somewhat of a brave movie but then again it doesn't hold together very well at times. Halle Berry is one of 3 young ladies that hook up with the Senator and follow him around, and she herself may have another motive for doing so. Most amusing is Beatty in South Central garb going down to the cleaners to check on his suit and hooking up with a bunch of little street hoodlums and buying them ice cream, only to end up having to defend them from the bullying cops in the area. I can't say this is a comfortable movie to watch, nor a family feature, not only because it has lots of bad words but it's also against other things that are apparently revered in this country, like the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you have an open mind and a sense of humor then you may like this. I myself don't care much for hip-hop or rap but in this it was at least tolerable. 7 out of 10."
19631_0,"Sorry but I have to say this film was truly awful. A repeat of the Thomas Crown affair, which was only good because of the originality of the 1960's script. Yes Ms Hayek does seem to get a lot of top and bottom shots, I wonder why that is? And Mr Brosnan squaring up to the physically inferior Mr Harrelson.<br /><br />Plainly the scene that said it all for me was when Mr FBI is getting some TLC from that Barbados copper, crap accent, and they repeat the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The one where Mr Ford is getting TLC from Ms Allen on the pirate boat, when Mr Ford is pointing to the bits of his face that hurt and Ms Allen is kissing them.<br /><br />So this movie has absolutely no imagination in the script. The acting is non-existent as the performers seem only to be massaging their ego's. Oh and that bloke from Neighbours the Aussie soap, as the ships captain, what accent was his meant to be? And the best part is, with no expensive sets, CG effects, crashing cars etc, this film would have been very cheap to make. And will make stacks of money. Like Mr Paul Zbyszewski's other production effort ""The Weakest Link"" what a talent! Sadly the rating scale does not go to Zero...."
19677_0,"Peyton Place anticipates the on-coming youth culture mantra of the 1960s wherein it is advisable to not trust anyone over thirty. Almost all the parental characters in this movie are focused on raising their offspring in such a manner that the kids will undoubtedly spend years in intensive therapy. Luckily the future looks bright for Peyton Place. There is a courtroom scene at the end in which a character, in this case a common sense doctor played by Lloyd Noland, is able to give a speech within the context of his testimony that sets the town in the proper moral direction. Where would Hollywood be without courtrooms for this type of scene to take place? Many conflicts are resolved and seemingly there is potential for living happily ever after, at least that is, until Return To Peyton Place...<br /><br />The cinematography and location shots give the film a nice visual vibe. Lorne Greene would have made a good Perry Mason. Hope Lange was definitely a talented beauty back in the day."
19721_0,"I actually didn't expect this film to very funny, as the cover mostly made it look like more of an action movie - but as it turns out it was very very funny. Great actors, great story and plot twists everywhere! It reminded a bit of ""Two Days In L.A."" but this one was far better. Most comedies nowadays have enough good jokes in them to last about ten minutes, but John Landis proves that movies like this still can be made."
19767_0,"The movie centers entirely around the interrogation of 6 people about the murder of a homeless girl relatively new to their Istanbul neighborhood. The stories told by each of the characters about their community, neighbors and the murder start out innocently, but bit by bit the oniony layers of the rotten story start to be peeled away revealing that nothing is as rosy as the neighbors would like to believe. Clever editing of the ever changing versions of stories by the different characters provides an often humorous, quick paced, entertaining film that in the end leaves you questioning where the facade ends and the truth really begins."

I lived in Battle Creek for 3 years so perhaps it just means more to me. <br /><br />This film was in fact shot in NY and NC, not Battle Creek, but they still did a great job portraying the romance of the early 1900's.<br /><br />The performances are top notch and the actors in this film are give their best. It's a great film, but not a critically acclaimed movie.<br /><br />Dana Carey could've had more lines, but what I want to know is what happened to the character actor who played him as a child, this kid was really great and could've been huge. <br /><br />The one liners in this movie are classic. It's one of those films that you think is funny, but when you recall it at a later date, its even funnier. <br /><br />So get a big, buttered bowl of popcorn and enjoy it for what it is! A hilarious tale of the wacky health craze of the early 1900's."
19857_0,"I can't believe people were actually paid for this film. I have never laughed so hard throughout a film. Billy Parrish, the guy who played Joey, where was he found? And the rest of the cast, did the director go out the day of shooting and ask random people on the street... ""Hey do you want to be in a movie... no just wear what you are wearing right now that's fine... no, there's no script, just say whatever you want."" Also, was the special effects guy paid? Because I'm sure you could have found someone who would have done it for free, then again, you'd have to pay me to add my name to that film. And the camera shots made me feel as if I was watching a soup opera movie. My friends and I want to make the sequel, we plan on using my hand-held camcorder (which I'm convinced the director for this movie used). So does anyone actually own the rights to this film, because I can't imagine anyone would want to."
19901_0,"I truly enjoyed this film, as did most everyone else at the World Premier in Toronto. Firstly, I haven't seen Spinal Tap, but of all the rest of his films, this is my favorite. His decision to depart the mockumentary format worked wonders in his favor. He didn't change his format so dramatically that you're unaware you're watching a Guest movie, it still carries his stamp. What he's done with this format is find a way to shave off all the somewhat boring bits that his other movies had durring the middle. Every second of this film was completely entertaining and will have you on the floor with laughter. The way he pokes fun of the silliness surrounding the Academy Awards is hilarious.<br /><br />Guest himself probably gave my favorite performance as the director of ""Home for Purim"", with Jennifer Collidge coming in second as the producer. I truly can't wait to see this movie again when it goes wide release."
19947_0,"I am an unabashed fan of Mr. Leconte. In fact, I have never seen a bad film from this director. Every film of his is completely unlike the others, and yet they all have his unmistakable stamp.<br /><br />Rue des Plaisirs takes its sweet time setting its story up, but it all moves very quickly, pace-wise, and the simplicity and beauty of the images is wonderful, and the little fable is ultimately very touching. Mr. Leconte rarely overstays his welcome - his films have reasonable running times and they say what they have to say and then they're done. If you don't know this director, you should seek out his films, especially Monseiur Hire, Intimate Strangers, The Widow of St. Pierre, Ridicule, and the great 1 Chance Sur Doux, with Belmondo, Delon, and Vanessa Paradis."
19992_0,"""The Evening Star"" is one of those movies that you can watch many times. It contains more laughs then ""Terms of Endearment"" and also less depth. But if you watch this movie in the observation that it is solely entertainment, and not to be taken seriously, it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine- reprising her Oscar winning role) is now dealing with her three grown Grandchildren. One is a saint, Teddy, who is already married with child. Tommy, the ""problem child"" of the original film, is in prison. And Melanie (Juliette Lewis), the youngest, is struggling through college because she's going through a rebellious phase and likes hanging out with her sleazy boyfriend, or mooching off Patsie (Miranda Richardson), the now very rich divorcée. There's also the loyal housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross), who despite always being on her duties and quick to have a sarcastic comeback, is falling in love with the next door neighbor Arthur (Ben Johnson- in his last screen performance).<br /><br />All of this is a little hokey, but the performances more then make up for it. When Aurora starts seeing a therapist (Bill Paxton) and then sleeping with him, people start whispering about her reputation. And when Melanie keeps going back and forth between her relationship, she finally finds peace with Aurora, who she at first despised.<br /><br />""The Evening Star"" is by no means superior to ""Terms of Endearment"". That movie is a landmark in it's own right. But it is more fun- in my opinion. MacLaine, in a funny performance, seems more lively and witty here then her original time around. And the most fun of all is to watch her and Miranda Richardson go at it - almost like ""Grumpy Old Men""- but FUNNIER. A scene in an airplane perfectly displays their hatred for one another- but in a way, they are best friends- since they're always around each other, competing, gossiping or nagging.<br /><br />To wrap it up, it's a long movie with a lot of unnecessary subplots (the death toll was ridiculous), but keep in mind this is also based on the book, so do we blame the filmmakers or the author? ""The Evening Star"" is a movie that should be watched for a good laugh. You don't have to have seen the first one to understand it. True, Debra Winger is missing (but if you saw the first film you'd know why), but I am rating this solely on how well it entertained me."
20035_0,"Last year I was worried that South Park might be losing it's edge, but last night's episode proved me wrong. Cartman Sucks is one of the freshest and funniest episodes to date. The episode doesn't deal entirely in the realm of original social commentary, but instead focuses on putting a twist on the classic story of Cartman pranks Butters.<br /><br />Cartman has been having Butters spend the night at his house and while little Butters sleeps, Cartman does terrible things to him (like making him a mustache from cat crap, or sticking a tampon on his mouth). When Butters once again spends the night, Cartman does one of the stupidest things ever: he puts Butters' penis in his mouth and takes a picture.<br /><br />The boys inform him that this makes him gay, and the only way to cancel this out is to stick his penis in Butters' mouth. While he is doing this, though, Butters' dad walks in with horrible assumptions. Cartman quickly flees, but Butters' father makes the horrible assumption that Butters is bi-curious.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Cartman can't find his photo and assumes Kyle took it and will show it to the whole class for show and tell. He spends the whole night trying to stop Kyle, but when he comes to no avail, he decides he'd rather expose himself.<br /><br />Butters is sent to Camp New Grace, where you ""Pray away the Gay."" At the camp, each child is assigned an accountabillibuddy. Butters, of course, has no idea what's going on and takes everything with the cheerful optimism that makes him such a beloved character. The campers continually commit suicide as they decide they'd rather go to hell now then be persecuted.<br /><br />Cartman's storyline ends with one of the greatest laughs I've had in awhile, and the episode becomes one of the new greats. It really doesn't make any original statements on the issue of gays, though it has tackled this subject several times in the past. The basic message is that everyone should have the freedom of choice and religion is the great hypocrisy to freedom of speech: religion bans free speech.<br /><br />But what I loved most about the episode was how Cartman's prank turned on him, and he went to such desperate measures to protect himself until he decides to expose himself. The picture itself is eventually seen, but Cartman is placed strategically in front of the screen to block any graphic elements. You get the idea though.<br /><br />This is also the first episode to strongly suggest Cartman's sexual orientation. In past episodes we've had several indicators as to what his preference is: In the Condoms episode he watches Butters put on a condom; in the Simpsons episode, he claims to have gotten semen by meeting some guy in an alley, closing his eyes, and sucking it out of a tube; having tea parties with his stuffed animals; dressing up like Britney Spears and making out with a cardboard cut-out of Justin Timberlake; and so on and so on. Making Cartman actually come out of the closet would probably be a stupid decision on the creators' part, instead of just providing strong hints of what Cartman prefers.<br /><br />Cartman Sucks may not contain a strong social commentary, but it basically is what I wanted: an episode more focused on an entertaining plot, rather then entirely on an issue. I half expected Ted Haggard to make an appearance, but the guys are leaving him buried for now."
20080_0,"I don't even think that this movie should deserve 1 star. I wish they gave the choice of .5 rating. anyway, the movies plot has less substance than a 1st graders creative writing paper. It is horrendous. I've seen better acting by Steven seagal. He would have made this movie at least a 2/10. The worst part I think was the special effects, I mean this movie was made in 2005 and uses TOY cars and fake model houses and power poles in avalanche scenes. The ICE QUEENs costume looks like a spandex suit from the consignment shop, covered in rubber tubes and grey spray paint. I estimate the budget of this movie was probably between 500-1000 dollars including the actors they picked up from the unemployment office. HORRIBLE, not worth paying for. though I did laugh from time to time, so if you can watch it for free and want a good laugh by making fun of all the goofs, then I recommend it."
20125_0,"A film whose time has come. Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson essentially play themselves as a songwriter and a cock-of-the-walk country god, and do it perfectly. The plot concerns Willie's character, Doc Jenkins, attempting to liberate himself from a contract he committed to when he was younger, drunker and a little less immortal. The supporting players are top of the line aces, including a surly Rip Torn and the always-great Melinda Dillon. Lesley Ann Warren is the new singer who Doc hitches his stars to, and she's convincing enough. The dialogue is fast, funny and, I suspect, captures the inside angle of the Music Business to a tee. One of the most unheralded great, little movies of all time. A better version of all those other syrupy, sentimental inside music movies."
20170_0,"Spoiled trust beneficiary playboy Jason Stevens is angry with his incalculably rich grandfather Red Stevens, and with his own life. When Red dies Jason shows up late for the funeral and makes a scene when he does show. But Red has prepared a ""gift"" for Jason's inheritance, unlike anything he leaves to the rest of the family. Indeed, Red leaves the rest of his self-absorbed and greedy Stevens family merely money. However, Jason's ""gift"" must be earned, and so Jason sets off on the quest. The quest for what Jason initially has no idea. In essence, Jason's quest is the quest of the aspiring knight who must slay his dragon to prove he is a man. Consequently, some may find the plot contrived or even hackneyed. But, as with all fables, it is the struggle that matters, not the circumstance, and what this movie shows is the very real struggle of all young men to find meaning in and a purpose for their lives. For some reason this kind of sentimentality is lately acceptable in war movies, but rarely elsewhere. Thus, it is refreshing to see in a context if minimal violence. When Jason finally gets his ""gift"" he has become a man that Red could be proud of, and who can be proud of himself. This is a deeply moving picture, and a well constructed one. But it is also one that one must be ready to watch."
20215_0,"I discovered this show by chance on a trip to Ireland and was exhilarated by its comic freshness and unexpected poignancy. The three lead actresses and one lead actor had terrific chemistry, and the writing could make you belly laugh and sob almost simultaneously. It is a mystery to me that ""After Henry"" has not made its way to these shores, where I'm confident it would join the top ranks of most beloved Britcoms. Are the programmers at PBS all dead in their offices at this point? They would do well to retire their endless reruns of jukebox ""specials"" and seek out savvy, unfamiliar programs like ""After Henry."" (If I hear ""Amazing Grace"" warbled just one more time, there will be havoc in Mudville.)"
20260_0,"I have watched very few silent movies over the years, but was very pleasantly surprised by this one. Harold Lloyd plays - as the title suggests - a shy tailor who is deathly afraid of girls (to the point at which he stutters every time he talks to one - interestingly done in a ""silent"" movie) and yet writes a book to teach young men how to understand and win girls. The book captures the attention of a well-to-do young lady, and we wonder if the two of them will ever manage to get together.<br /><br />The story was delightful, and although entirely predictable, was fun to watch. The chase scene at the end of the movie as Lloyd attempts to ""get the girl"" before her marriage was quite well filmed, and the humour throughout, while not outrageous, was amusing. My only criticism is the message that a ""poor boy"" can't win a ""rich girl"" unless he has the money (although in fairness this seemed to be a problem for Lloyd's character and not for the girl.) All in all, this was a very pleasant way to spend an hour and a half on a lazy Saturday morning."
20305_0,"In my opinion this is their second best live show surpassed only by Hooligan's Island. To sum up the plot, this line from the show says it all: ""Stop turning everything dirty, will you, I'm trying to f**k the Queen!"" - yes, that's the plot :D The first half of the show is great fun (God save the Quim, Eddie?) but it's the second half that really gets me in tears from laughter. Among other things you will in this half experience Ade getting kicked (for real) in the b******s by Rik (poor guy) which I must admit I giggle about every time. And the later scene with their girlfriends (well ... blow-up dolls, actually) gets me laughing just thinking about it. So if you in any shape or form are into vulgar humor, cricket bat violence and blow-up doll action, this is a show for you. Watch it now! 9/10"
20350_0,"I cannot began to discribe my feelings towards ""Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz"" simply because, It is in this reviewers option. The film is a most excellent ending to the greatest animated series of our time! Why? It took all the elements of the series, and all of the questions that the fans have had. (Such as ""What was Operation M?"") and it not only answers them in full detail, but it also gave us a more clear view of our favorite Piolts past(s). <br /><br />Yet while this is an animated film, it is not ment for small childern however. I would recomend this to any anime fan, or for anyone who simply enjoys brilliant stories and movie making!"
20396_0,"Columbo's Most Dangerous Match is about chess. An unlikely subject or motive for murder in my opinion. The star is Manchurian Candidate's Lawrence Harvey who plays a deaf chess champion. He is terrified of losing and will do anything to maintain his status as world chess champion. His competitor is a Russian chess champion who unlike Lawrence Harvey's character is well-regarded and loved instead. He lures him into an unusual trap to prevent him from defeating. Columbo always knows how to work a prime suspect and does it by being fascinated in their work particularly chess. One of Columbo's trademarks is that he gets interested in the character's passion and in this one, it's chess. He finds it a hell of game with a lot to lose on each side. You have to know that it's kind of hard watching Columbo catch this one. You almost feel sorry for him and in that, Lawrence Harvey gives a memorable performance since his role in the Manchurian Candidate."
20440_0,"I have mixed feelings for this movie. I truly liked the original ""Goal"" mainly because I'm a huge soccer fan. Not that the sequel is a bad movie but in my opinion, it lacked of reality moments. Let me explain myself...<br /><br />Sure, the movie is very well done because it has good acting, an interesting romantic plot, and tries to display the ups and downs of being a famous soccer player. The transfer negotiations and trainings were also a nice addition to help understand how it works. Also, it was great to see Real Madrid's starts in small cameos. So, ""Goal 2"" succeeds because it's a blockbuster movie and probably a favorite among young audiences. The events of the movie are truly over the top but it works. I really hope that Santiago's half brother plot will be important in the next ""Goal""! <br /><br />On the other side, I expected more interaction with Real player's. Also I expected more seriousness on the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE sub-plot. I mean, it's the most important soccer event in the world after the FIFA WORLD CUP. The director and producer made it look like just another tournament. But on the bright side, I liked that some real matches were displayed with the occasional CGI help. Also, it isn't that easy to score in these kind of games! But oh well, I understand it's only a movie :)and a good one.<br /><br />Watching Zidane (the last soccer genius) and Ronald wearing the Real Madrid outfit was great and powerful. <br /><br />The direction and visuals are spectacular. The soccer matches looked great with the aid of CGI and brilliant cinematography. I expected more soccer related scenes though. Kuno Becker delivers a good performance again. I'm glad for him. Alessandro Nivola steals the show as Gavin Harris, overrated soccer superstar. Anna Friel looked mature but sexy as hell and delivered a good performance (love her accent). Stephen Dillane also delivers a fine performance as Santiago's former assistant. Rutger Hauer also delivers a good performance; he's always the man.<br /><br />So give it a chance for ""Goal 2"" if you are a huge soccer fan. Otherwise, you might enjoy it for it's dramatic plot and romantic situations.<br /><br />Hopefully, in ""Goal 3"" we will get to see Santiago leading Mèxico to win the FIFA WORLD CUP. That could only happen in a movie :("
20486_0,"This is a real hidden gem -- corny, yes, but incredibly charming. One of those movies I can't stop watching once I come across it while flipping around the channels. Most of the comments here echo my own thoughts, wonderful performances and a solid if somewhat clichéd script -- but it works its charm on you! I love the mayor's line, ""I couldn't be happier if I were twins."" Lastly, it occurred to me that it's like an American version of a great Bill Forsyth movie, Local Hero! Rent that one and see the parallels."
20530_0,"And just to make sure you get it right, i'll repeat myself: Watch the french original! It's so much better, starting from the cast (Queen Latifah is so miscast, it hurts), straight to the story/humor (it's just not right)! <br /><br />The best scene (to at least have one good comment about the title) is a scene involving Jennifer Esposito and Gisele Bündchen, which had a sort of ""tension"" to it, that was funny and sexy at the same time! Funnily (or maybe not so funny) enough, with the cast here, you'd be excused to think that it would be more often like that. But it's neither funny nor sexy ... and I'm not talking at the same time, at all! Except the one scene ... but that doesn't save the movie, which just is too long and has nothing going for it! It's a shame, because Jimmy Fallon can be funny, but here he's just annoying!"
20576_0,"May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.<br /><br />In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.<br /><br />I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10."
20620_0,"Saw this at the Midwest Independent Film Festival. Really enjoyed the ambiguity of the symbolism. Very clever - the symbols work for Christian viewers as well as devotees of modern psychology, myth structure, what-have-you. The question lingers, of course, at the end: was it a dream? Was there even ever a man and a dog? Was this truly a wayfarer or was this the inner struggle made flesh? The case for the wandering man being Christ is strong if you tend toward those lines of thinking (obviously that's my first leaning): he died for the main character's sins. Then in that case what is the dog, but the burden of caretaking, the concept of blind selflessness and charity towards others (""he doesn't have a name""), that Christianity extols? I cannot speak for other worldviews' interpretation of the movie but I am sure there are similar explanations for Freudian, Jungian, etc., paradigms.<br /><br />Conversations with the filmmakers revealed that there intentionally was no one true explanation of the film. A story of redemption and sacrifice, laden with traditional symbolism, that lets the viewer take from it what he wants. Strongly recommended."
20666_0,"This movie is pure, unadulterated cinematic genius. The only reason that I did not give it a 10 was that it did not surpass the greatness of Bas's previous movie, The Eliminator. First of all, I would like to address all you people who gave this movie any lower than 3 stars, which was a surprising amount of you. You are all bad people. And ugly. Probably. Many of you commented on how ""fake"" the scenes of vault gears, rocket launchers, etc looked like. Well, let me ask you this. Have you actually been inside the workings of a fully functional vault door? Have you actually been staring down the barrel of a rocket launcher as it fired its missile at you? Have you actually seen a helicopter explode as its blades landed not 2 feet in front of you? Have any of you actually experienced the blast of a C4 detonation? For all we know, the blast could be so strong that it effects its immediate surroundings seconds before it actually combusts. Those of you ""critics"" out there should really think about experiencing these things before you actually go out and condemn this movie for its faults.<br /><br />As for the movie, it is cinema at its finest. The lead character Kennedy Kaludes, played by Laci Szabo, is a thief, a hero, but most importantly, a loving father. I love how you are able to identify with the character, since right off the bat he give us some vital information about himself. It was once said that you never really know someone until you know their favorite food and color. I was really very surprised to hear that his favorite things are, respectively ***SPOILER*** Philly Cheese Steaks (although we later learn that he likes those big New York pretzels) and purple ***END SPOILER*** His daughter Milla, played by Brynn Lucas, is a naive, young girl who wants to love her father, despite him not really knowing her. It is very touching during the ending of the movie, when we learn that her favorite food and color is ***SPOILER*** Clams and also purple ***END SPOILER***. Bas Rutten plays General Matos, an antagonist with a sense of humor. This role fits him very well, because he is a very funny guy behind the scenes, as said by his fellow crew, and can do one hell of a British accent. Paul Logan plays Matos's right hand man, Frix. Oh, Frix. Grace, played by Diana Lee Inosanto is a fabulous actress with the fighting skills to back it up. She beat up those inept security guards like no one else could. In all, this movie is one that the whole family can enjoy. Thank you Bas. Keep 'em coming."
20710_0,"A rare misfire for film director Rob Reiner, this film has very little in the way of story, emotional push & pull and interesting subject matter. Advertised as a ""comedy"", and even verified as such by the director, this film does not have one semi amusing part in it. The problem is that there are scenes which are meant to be humorous, not in the laugh out loud way, but in the way that little things can make serious situations amusing, but they do not work. This film is about as exciting as watching paint dry- nothing happens, there are no compromises and no one really discovers anything they didn't already know. In one scene Paul Reiser as Willis' agent states that people who have very little leisure time don't want to read about a persons life that they didn't know, and wasn't famous- it seems pointless. In a few words- we don't want to watch it either! The filmmakers should have thought about this, because that's what this film is- pointless. There is some good acting, and it may be true about there being 6 people in the bed - but do we really want to know about it over 90 minutes. A total waste of time, and an incredibly disappointing effort."
20756_0,"loosely focusing on Lucanio's life in Italy, this movie combines elements of documentary, gangster flick and political movie. <br /><br />a Reality component is added to the movie by Charles Siragusa playing himself as prosecutor of Luciano. In the real world Siragusa failed to prove Luciano's involvement in drug trafficking from sicily into the US. and in this movie he seems to put an effort into using the results of his work to render luciano's role in the business.<br /><br />in the first half of the movie there is an extended sequence about vito genovese's time in italy something that seems completely disconnected from the rest of the plot, no hints are given about his actual connection to luciano and his role in the Gene Giannini hit shown later in the movie.<br /><br />things may be very confusing for viewer who doesn't know the biographies of people like luciano, vito genovese, joe pagano, meyer lansky and other mobsters as the movie constantly jumps between different periods of times, places and people without explaining their interconnections.<br /><br />so that being informed on those characters should be necessary to understand what this movie is about.<br /><br />for the whole time characters are elaborated very well and portrayed in a humanistic way supported by the brilliant soundtrack composed of a couple of 50ies jazz tunes and absolute top level cinematography.<br /><br />the performances delivered by Volonte as Lucky Luciano and Rod Steiger as Gene Giannini are on a Level that remains to be seen in other movies.<br /><br />culminating in the Gene Giannini hit where the atmosphere reaches a level of stunning dramatical density."
20800_0,"The above question wan posed by an irate woman called ""Nell?"" Now, that's an odd insult that she used: a sun-baked ham? Well, in an old film, particularly a Three Stooges short that is 68 years old, you're going to get a lot of strange name-calling. I suppose in real life, the boys would be called a lot worse.....a lot worse.<br /><br />Daisy, Tessie, Flossie and Nell (the old coot who has no patience with the bumbling boys) actually hire the Stooges to take them West so they can perform their singing and dancing act. Of course, five months into the trip they've only made it about 100 miles to Kansas and Nell has lost her patience. Can't blame the poor woman.<br /><br />The bulk of the story contains classic Three Stooges gags, some of which are good no matter how many times, or in how many films, you seem them: like the grizzly bear wandering into the shed and Curly, at first, thinking it's a warm blanket.<br /><br />Then, PC-aside, we get the normal adventures with Indians which are usually pretty funny. The highlight, however, of this ""western adventure,"" is the ice-fishing scene..Without giving too much away, suffice to say all three Stooges wind up taking humorous plunges into the icy waters. You can't help but laugh out loud at some of them."
20846_0,"Little Britain is a hilarious British Comedy that stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams that play several characters each. This has made me laugh in many ways such as Marjorie Dawes (Fat Fighters), Carol ""Computer Says No"" Beer, Judy and Maggie, Mr Mann, ""Bubbles"" De Vere etc. <br /><br />Most of it gives me a laugh although it gets repetitive and predictable after a while and it's not so funny.

20891_0,"My Rating: * out of ****. <br /><br />I saw Anger Management for the purpose that there was not much else out. Lets just say, I hated it. I think Adam Sandler has an uneven resume, there are movies I like of his and there are some I just dont care for. I have never actually hated one of his movies (although I never saw Little Nicky, nor do I want to), but Anger Management actually begins a new category. Adam Sandler movies that are plain terrible. <br /><br />Anger Management offers an interesting premise. But with all the bad and unfunny jokes its just a mess of a movie. There may have been possibly one time when I laughed, but thats it. Theres a twist at the end that I would have thought was more clever, if the movie had been somewhat watchable.<br /><br />The acting is not much of a strength. I thought Adam Sandler was great in 2002's Punch Drunk Love, but I found him unconvincing and dull here. Jack Nicholson makes his character into a caricature. This performance does call for Nicholson to be over the top, but hes just ridiculous and kind of annoying. I wanted his scenes to be cut or maybe someone else to play the character. Marisa Tomei is somewhat pleasant to save a few scenes of the movie, but she is not in it much. <br /><br />Anger Management could have been good, and thats probably the biggest disappointment. It needed a more intelligent script, and as much as I'm a fan of Jack Nicholson, I dont think he should have been in this movie. Anger Management is a waste of a movie."

20981_0,"This isn't a war film, it features in a time of was with POW's and their jailers, but it is at its heart about the magnificence of the human spirit. A marvellous example of hope. The worst and the best of the human condition is on display, it doesn't succumb to tricks or props, it doesn't need to, because what it has is emotion. Get out your hankies. Be prepared for marvellous performances by all of the cast, nobody stands out because that was the way it needed to be played.<br /><br />This film is one of those you must see. I bought it for under £5.00 at my Choices video store, and what a bargain that was. Go out and buy this film now and add it to your collection."

What is so brilliant is that there has been no interference from any scriptwriter. It was taken straight from the Bible - word for word and that's what counts!"
21115_0,"No matter where in the world, sex and violence in the cinema have always gone hand-in-hand.<br /><br />Italian giallos; UK Hammer horror; the many films of Spain's Jess Franco; the trashy US gore flicks of H.G. Lewis: every country seems to have made its own contributions that combine the two elements.<br /><br />Violent 'pinku' movies are the Far East's offering, and many fans of extreme cinema agree that they rule the roost as far as sexual nastiness is concerned, since almost nothing seems to be 'too taboo' to be portrayed. Assault! Jack The Ripper (a misleading title, if ever there was one, since 'Saucy Jack' is nowhere to be seen!), from director Yasuharu Hasebe, is a classic example of the genre and clearly illustrates why no-one does sleaze quite like the Japanese!<br /><br />After a fatal mishap with a crazy hitch-hiker, a pathetic pastry chef and a chubby domineering waitress discover that, for them, killing is a mutual aphrodisiac. They set about abducting and carving up innocent women (more often than not, by stabbing them in the cooch!) in order to fuel their sex life, but, when the chef eventually decides to go solo on his murder sprees, their bizarre relationship begins to crumble.<br /><br />With umpteen steamy sex scenes, a couple of repulsive rapes, and loads of grisly deaths, Assault! is not a film for your 'casual' viewer. The killers are completely callous and, although the numerous crotch stabbings are not explicitly shown, the sheer offensiveness of the acts (coupled with some suitably yucky sound effects) is enough to upset most 'normal' people. Rabid fans of politically incorrect exploitation, however, will have a field day watching the killers as they indulge in all manner of wickedness, including a marvellously depraved finalé, in which an entire room-full of nurses are rapidly dispatched.<br /><br />And if all that excess wasn't enough, solid acting, good production values, and a great score all go to ensure that Assault! is an experience that you won't forget in a hurry.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
21160_0,I like this movie very much. Anyone committing or having committed ID Theft should be made to watch this movie no less than 20hrs a day and not less than 2yrs every day. Maybe then people will understand what kind of damage they have caused and stop and think about it. I can personally related because two people in my extended family did this and they're getting off the easy way. No sympathy should be the punishment. Anyway I thought the movie was directed and performed with the excellence to make this seem so realistic and not twist the truth of what happened. I think everyone should watch this movie. It really gives you an idea of what can happened when you least expect it.
21205_0,"Hey, what can I say? My son, my then-future son-in-law, and most of their friends were involved with it! A good amateur first effort. Filmed in and around Rapid City, South Dakota, with Stevens High School students and staff(?). Few movies out there will thank a local preacher for the loan of his car! A few of the people involved with this film went on to bigger and better things in the entertainment world. Part of the reason this movie was made, IMO, was a tribute to a very good and popular drama teacher. These guys discovered that the Black Hills and the Badlands were good movie ground before Hollywood did. Then they went on to experiment with making their own. This was big stuff for high schoolers in 1992! Now, it would be on YouTube. Compared to some of the stuff I've seen on SciFi channel lately, this is still awesome and certainly wears better."

I recently watched this cartoon a 15 years at least since I last saw it and laughed out loud at all the pranks that Bugs pulled out of his hat. I know I must have used some of these jokes when I was playing baseball as a kid.<br /><br />And the cameo at the end of America's perennial first lady was a hoot - and Bugs goes and lampoons her on the spot!<br /><br />Classic is the only word for this one."
21296_0,"""Clear and Present Danger"" is the second adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel to feature Harrison Ford as CIA agent Jack Ryan. This film involves a murder which is linked to drug cartels in Colombia and the subsequent efforts to take action against the cartels.<br /><br />Harrison Ford proves again that he is well-suited to the role of Jack Ryan and more appropriate than Alec Baldwin and Ben Affleck for the role. There are some great supporting performances as well, particularly from James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe and Henry Czerny. Henry Czerny developed an interesting character and the rivalry between him and Jack Ryan was excellent.<br /><br />The story of this film is better developed than that of ""Patriot Games"" (1992), which is why I prefer this film. It goes beyond a simple ""Jack Ryan combats criminals"" story. There is not a lot of intrigue per se, but some interesting turns and friction between Ryan and officials within the United States government. There are also some well-made action sequences in the film to supplement the story. The film's ending was interesting and appropriate. ""Clear and Present Danger"" proved to be more interesting than its predecessor film, ""Patriot Games"" (1992)."

The children was alright though, but the adult actors.......<br /><br />The actions of the characters are so stupid that you think a 5 year old have scripted it.<br /><br />Well you can say it started so well and ended very bad.

El Tigre de Santa Julia (The Tiger of Santa Julia) is a Mexican heroes. History happens to beginnings of 20th century. This movie tell us the history about a Man who was born in a small town in Mexico at 1880, He was left by his father when his mother died, 20 years later, he got to Santa Julia, another small town near to Mexico city, he went to find a better life, with few money and helped for her aunt, he join the Mexican army, but he discovered that they wasn't fighting against another army, they fought against people, people who disagree the government, an antidemocratic government. He refuse the army and star a band, like Robin Hood, they rob rich people to gave them to the poor people. All the other members of his band was female, because they were more loyal, and brave. This is a good movie, is funny, has action, and let us know about a Mexican heroes that many of us don't know."
21430_0,"Hideo Nakata's follow-up to ""Ring"" is terrifying stuff. Building on the events of the first film and following the dreadful video curse through to the next level, it is a very worthy successor to the original classic.<br /><br />In terms of filmmaking style, very little has changed. ""Ring 2"" is high quality horror filmmaking, including excellent music, a couple of nasty shocks (used sparingly, making them all the more effective) and some really frightening images which stay in your mind long after the film is over. We also learn more about Sadako and the circumstances leading up to her imprisonment and death, which deepens the horror by making the audience more compassionate towards the object of fear. This is the sort of thing that classic Western horror USED to do, but now it is more concerned with shock tactics and tongue-in-cheek self-referencing (see ""Scream"") to bother with good old-fashioned empathy.<br /><br />This is not to say that we grow to love Sadako any more in this film than in the first. She is still very much the epitome of evil. ""Ring 2"" also makes less sense than its predecessor and demands more leaps of the imagination than the first film did. That said, the irrationality leads to some truly terrifying moments: the way the curse marks all media (photos, videos, any TV in range); the whole sequence with the well; the flashback sequence at the Inn where Sadako was raised. By not trying to be too logical about the plot here, Nakata actually taps into a deeper vein of horror, although it makes ""Ring 2"" slightly less satisfying than its predecessor.<br /><br />Everything about this production is so good that it barely even needs to be mentioned. The acting is terrific, particularly Miki Nakatini as Mai, burdened with a psychic capacity she doesn't want and drawn into the mystery against her will. Rikiya Otaka also deserves a mention as Yoichi (the little boy from the first film) - his expressions of blank terror and occasional moments of rage are very effective indeed.<br /><br />Don't watch ""Ring 2"" alone and don't expect to sleep easy afterwards. This is good quality horror the way it hasn't been made in Hollywood for a good few years now - go with a friend!"
21476_0,"The line above is from the original advertising art, and it conveys the theme of HARRIET CRAIG very well. I have an issue with reviewers who are constantly comparing characters on the screen with the actors who portray them. Harriet Craig was a character, and that is all. There are parallels between the lives of the character and Joan Crawford herself, but one should not go so far as to say they are the same! Joan Crawford is a woman of many mysteries. Every account you could possibly read about her life is full of contradictions; was she good or was she bad, was the ruthless and cruel or was she generous and kind? She was probably all of these things and, like Harriet Craig, a complicated, non-conventional, and independent woman at war with the world.<br /><br />This is where the comparison ends. The character in the film is a compulsive liar and manipulator. Harriet Craig lies about anything and everything in the spider's web she builds around her. Joan Crawford's performance is fierce and chilling in its complexity. This is a woman of astounding talent, playing a character worthy of that talent. This is one of only a handful of roles Crawford ever played that allowed her to really act, which she does so well you will forget all about those other ""great"" actresses which usually claim all the credit.<br /><br />If 1950 was not such a tough year, I'm convinced Joan would have received an Oscar nomination for the performance. The film itself was worthy of a nomination and, as the advertising art claimed, was ""one of the five best pictures of the year."" I think it is comparable in quality to ALL ABOUT EVE and SUNSET BLVD., and certainly Crawford's performance is on par with the leads in those films, and one of the best of her career! One last final note: a feminist take on HARRIET CRAIG may emphasize that Harriet was just a woman trying to survive the sexist times...but Wendell Corey was such a good and nice husband, believing in their equality, that I don't buy it. Harriet was a woman hurt by her times and unfortunately taking out her mistrust of men on her innocent and good husband, as well as others around her. Harriet was, in the end, a victim of her own prejudice, and selfish, compulsive lies."
21520_0,"The great thing about Joe Dante in the 1980s was his knack for instilling humor into the sci-fi genre. Innerspace is probably one of the greats in that category, mixing in some great special effects (for its time) and some hillarious performances by Martin Short and Dennis Quaid. But what I especially enjoyed was the concept, turning a film that could have been serious and urgent into a film that was both funloving and interesting to watch. Sure, the whole idea is bupkiss and it was an homage to Fantastic Voyage, but the twist Dante put on it certainly makes it worth watching over and over."
21566_0,"I wonder if this movie somehow inspired ""Evil Dead II""!! A demoniac and perverted hand with a bad attitude spreads terror. That's all you need to know.<br /><br />Damn it, the effect of the moving hand is the best feature about this cheapie mess. The hand's performance was truly menacing and comic at the same time! It starts a killing spree while possessing, then, it hides under Samantha Eggar's sheets (dirty hand!), and if it wasn't enough, it jumps over a moving car without a stunt double. That's my kind of entertainment. <br /><br />Now seriously, this movie is as cheap as you can imagine. There are some unintentionally funny situations, CHEAP false scares, horrible f/x, and putrid score. Not even the groovy music is likable.<br /><br />The premise is good but you can't do anything good with such an extremely low budget and cheap production values. But in defense of this movie, it's meant to be pure B-entertainment. Although the movie is boring, it has it's moments of cheesiness and Mystery Science Theatre material. <br /><br />At some points I thought I was watching a bad episode of ""Miami Vice""! The car chasing, and shootings just demonstrate how poor this Horror oriented movie is. <br /><br />""The Hand will kill again!"". Oh , I forgot to praise the horrible one-liners."
21610_0,"Very cheesy, direct to video B-movie. Although the acting was pretty good. There were a lot of first rate actors in the movie Ernie Hudson, Nia Long, Donnie Wahlberg, etc. The story was cheesy and simplistic. It was not very interesting and although I actually watched the whole thing I was rather bored with it. I can see why this was not distributed in movie theaters. I don't think it would have done very well. My advice is don't spend your hard earned money to rent this. Wait for it to come on cable or borrow it from somebody who has already wasted their money on it like I did."
21656_0,"An interesting movie and a worthy part of the Sherlock Holmes tradition. The most interesting part for was the use of the count down notes as the members of the organization died. It even included a red herring note. If the viewer is paying attention, it is a clue to the actual murderer. <br /><br />Agatha Christie, the well known English mystery writer who also has had many books made into movies, used a similar motif in her book, Ten Little Indians. The most fascinating part, though, is that this movie was made in 1933 and Ten Little Indians was published in 1939.<br /><br />Christie may have borrowed from this movie for her plot."

21836_0,"I found out about this film long before I was able to rent it and I know I'll own it soon. I read some great reviews at Movies.com on it and it seems like it is held in great respect by critics who know it was unfairly snubbed by the Academy and even Golden Globes because of a young, yet talented cast with a low budget-an independent film! Director James Toback originally wanted Leonardo Dicaprio to play the leading role, because of Titanic - he became 'too expensive' which was actually a good thing. The director then cast Adrien Grenier in place - thank god! The film has a realistic theme and comes somewhere between 'Traffic' and 'American Beauty'. Sarah Michelle Gellar was Toback's first choice to play Cindy Bandollini and despite her heavy schedule and limited time she could spend on making the film because of 'Buffy' I think she did really well. It must be difficult to really set herself in and give a good performance when she has such little time. Her character was quite enjoyable - she was the most entertaining person in the film. Without SMG this films would have been a complete flop. The film is an eye opener for teenagers -<br /><br />they are set in a place that makes them feel like they are on a drug trip - the fact that taking LSD would never bring you down again is a frightening thought for teenagers playing with fire. The film's scenes are presented in a clever way - the effect of speeding up conversation is effective. It is a complicated film that will leave most people in the dark. After watching it for the 3rd time - it really does make out to be a great film! I recommend it!"

21926_0,"Burt Lancaster(who I just thought was great, though he battled with the accent just a bit..a minor squabble)portrays Bob Valdez, a former Apache hunter for the Calvary now a constable who accidentally shoots an innocent black man claimed to have murdered the husband of Gay Erin(the beautiful redheaded Susan Clark). Gay's lover is Frank Tanner(Jon Cypher), the leader of a band of cutthroats who lead the crusade to take out the black man who was mistaken for being the one who killed Gay's husband. Valdez tried to smooth things over by consulting with the black man, but hothead RL Davis(Richard Jordan..a bucketful of energy and spunk)open fires before the constable to get the honest proof of the victim's innocence. Valdez ends up killing the innocent man and desires all who fingered him to pay for the man's pregnant squaw to have passage home. This is an insult to Frank who is a racist pig who loathes the sight of ""greaser"" Valdez. When Valdez persists, in kindness and gentle-care, Frank to pay $100, he is is attacked and roped to a wooden cross..they send him into the desert this way to perish. RL Davis is sent on his way when he is told by Frank that he couldn't shoot straight. RL, in his only moment of kindness in the film, releases Valdez from his ropes after an incident when Bob tried to break the wood roped to his arms. After being lent help and rest by his friend, Valdez will seek revenge for what Frank and his cronies did to him. What Frank and co. doesn't know is that Valdez is a great shot and smart tactician. He knows the mountains and is a wily problem for Frank to solve. Still Valdez has a problem when RL tells Frank of Bob's friend's helping him and this act of betrayal proves once and for all that RL is a greedy lowlife simply desiring to be one of the guys. Still Frank will continue to underestimate Valdez who knows the entire country all too well. Before it's over, Frank will, without a doubt, know that..Valdez is coming. The film is a blast to watch. It's one of those vendetta entertainments that often frequent the multiplexes in the 60's and 70's when the rules, thanks in large part to Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"", were starting to be broken. We were actually seeing the men act and talk the way they did in those days. The mean behavior exhibited by crooked men who lived for wealth and prestige. In this film Frank seems to be one mean sonofabitch and finds that he is slowly losing his men one by one to a superior enemy he misjudged because of different skin color. He automatically looked at him as a weak peasant instead of a great gunfighter and that theme works greatly here in this short and satisfying western."

22015_0,"Admittedly the reason that I first decided to see Ten Inch Hero was for Jensen Ackles (Priestly) who I must say did not disappoint, the young actor has wonderful comedic timing. However, I returned to the Phoenix film festival for a second viewing of the film (with all my friends in tow) for an entirely different reason. The film is incredible and I can honestly say I that I would watch it again and again, a point that everyone who accompanied me to the screening would agree to. In general the acting was superb, Clea DuVall has immense presence as the shy and self-conscious Jen and John Doe is excellent as usual as the quirky Trucker. The story itself is wonderful, simple yet not to the point of boredom as it has several twists and turns that even my best friend who has a knack for ruining all plots reversals for me couldn't guess. I can't wait the see this film in theater or at the very least on DVD and would love so much to be able to have in my possession the soundtrack of this movie. The the soundtrack alone (trust me on this one) is worth seeing the movie for, the original songs by Bethany Joy Galeotti are incredible! All I can say is that I am so glad Jensen Ackles was chosen to play Priestly or I likely would never have seen this film, and that would truly have been a huge shame."
22060_0,"I haven't seen 'Love Affair (1939),' but I have seen 'An Affair to Remember (1957),' and that film undoubtedly owed something to Tay Garnett's 'One Way Passage (1932).' In McCarey's film, a trans-Atlantic liner becomes a metaphor for love: two people fall hopelessly for one another, becoming adrift on a vessel of passion that precludes all former relationships or future life plans. When the ship reaches its destination  New York  reality intrudes on emotion, and love is thrown into turmoil. In 'One Way Passage,' the reality is death itself. Joan (Kay Francis) has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and will be lucky to survive the journey to America. Dan (William Powell) has been convicted for murder, and in San Quentin awaits his gallows. Neither knows that the other is walking death row, either figuratively or literally, but love intercedes on their behalf: just as a star is brightest before its extinction, so too is love at its most passionate when the lovers' time is limited. <br /><br />Despite its very brief running time (67 minutes), 'One Way Passage' is one of the great unsung romances. An aura of hope pervades the film. Though the viewer is always aware of the inevitable, I loathe to describe the story as a ""doomed romance."" Such a label would properly refer to, say, Lean's 'Brief Encounter (1945)' or Ophüls' 'Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948),' in which the prevailing mood is that of tragedy and misspent emotion. In 'One Way Passage,' not an ounce of passion goes to waste, each lover fully aware that their time together is brief. I was also struck by the notion that love doesn't necessarily entail complete openness between lovers. Lying, if done to protect rather than deceive, can be the most heartbreakingly romantic thing of all (I'm reminded of the devoted father in 'A Night to Remember (1958)' who, with admirable composure, assures his family that the Titanic will not sink, despite knowing that his own death is unavoidable). Garnett's casual use of long takes in masterful, giving the story a poetic fluidity without drawing attention to itself.<br /><br />William Powell was one of the busiest stars of the 1930s, enjoying the security of, not one, but two recurring characters (Philo Vance and Nick Charles, both detectives). 'One Way Passage' was produced by Warner Brothers before he moved to M-G-M in 1934. Even before 'The Thin Man (1934),' however, Powell was one of the classiest stars in Hollywood, here delivering his dialogue with unsurpassed aplomb. Kay Francis was a new face for me, but her eyes simply sparkle with life and emotion, her character torn between the joys of love and the heartbreak of impending death. Of the supporting players, only Frank McHugh  as a drunken pickpocket with a weaselly cackle  destroyed the mood of the film, his alcoholism far less amusing than Nick Charles' subsequent hankering for martinis. While Aline MacMahon and Warren Hymer are strong, 'One Way Passage' truly belongs to Powell and Francis, and to a love than persists long after its participants have moved on to other worlds."
22105_0,"If one rates a film on visuals alone, Fellini's SATYRICON would surely be completely off the scale: a phantasmagorical mixture of sensual beauty and the distasteful but evocative grotesque set in an ancient Rome that never was, never could have been, and yet which plays up to every extreme concept we secretly harbor about Roman decadence. The leading men are incredibly beautiful; the women are generally seductively depraved; and the broad vision that Fellini offers is easily one of the visually stunning creations ever put to film.<br /><br />And yet, oddly, the film is sterile. The story is impossible to describe, a series of largely unrelated events in the lives of two impossibly handsome youths (Martin Potter and Hiram Keller) who begin the film by battling over the sexual favors of a slave boy (Max Born) who alternately unites and divides them until all three find themselves sold into slavery and flung from adventure to adventure, most often with sexual (and frequently homosexual) connotations. Clearly, Fellini is making a statement about the triviality and emptiness of a life lived for physical pleasures alone.<br /><br />But the film is jumpy, disjointed, disconnected; the sequences do not always arise from each other in any consistent way, leaving viewers with a sort of ""what the ..."" reaction when the film unexpectedly shifts without explanation. (This is actually in keeping with the original ancient text, of which only portions remain.) In consequence, SATYRICON is ultimately less about any philosophical statement Fellini may have had in mind than it is about sheer pictorial splendor and deliberate weirdness.<br /><br />Whatever its failings, it is an astonishing film, and one that would have tremendous influence on a host of directors who followed in Fellini's wake--although all to often without his style and vision. Clearly Pasolini, director of such works as SALO, ARABIAN NIGHTS, and CANTERBURY TALES spent the better part of his largely unlamented life trying to out-Fellini Fellini; likewise, it is impossible to imagine how Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione arrived at the notorious CALIGULA without reference to Fellini's SATYRICON.<br /><br />Such efforts to expand on SATYRICON were merely more explicit and less interesting than the original, and I do not really recommend them--nor do I really recommend SATYRICON for any one other than Fellini fans, for with its oddly disjointed feel it is unlikely to please those raised on mainstream. Still, it is a powerful, remarkably beautiful, and completely unexpected film that must be seen at least once by any one with a serious interest in world cinema, and to those I recommend it without hesitation.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
22150_0,"Since this film doesn't have huge studio promotion or A-list stars, you might be inclined to dismiss it. But this is a very entertaining film, with a surprisingly good look for a small-budget independent production. This football film has lots of solid action and avoids most of the usual cliches. It features solid performances by a mostly unknown cast. Nearly everything works -- the drama is dramatic, the comedy is funny. Do yourself a favor and give this film a chance."

22240_0,"The man has created some of the most remarkable American films of all time (obviously). These movies include RAGING BULL, TAXI DRIVER, MEAN STREETS, GOODFELLAS... The list goes on. However, there is so much to cherish about WHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR, and it lingers in the memory long afterward, to such an extent that I wonder if it's my favorite of his work.<br /><br />I realize that it's a rough-edged, ultra low budget movie. That in itself fails to hinder its impact. In fact, the evident workmanship on display serves to heighten its effectiveness, since the visible seams lend a sense of unease and unpredictability that accentuates the central character's uncertainty about his personal values, which is the key subject at hand.<br /><br />Keitel's performance is exceptional. It's his first film, but his emotional range was already astounding. Others have mentioned that his mannerisms and speech patterns are reminiscent of Scorsese's own public image, and I couldn't agree more. It's a very personal movie from a man who, particularly in the early years of his career, openly explored his own morality.<br /><br />Zina Bethune, as The Girl, is a bit stilted at times but still manages to deliver a fine performance. Her role is so well written that it would be almost impossible for her to have failed at creating an interesting character.<br /><br />Scorsese's visual style here is kinetic, experimental and compelling. Much of it owes a great deal to the French New Wave films that were popular throughout the 60s, and it also pays homage to the films of John Cassavetes, SHADOWS in particular. A good deal of the acting appears to be semi-improvised, and it works beautifully.<br /><br />WHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR will prove to be a challenge for a lot of viewers. The narrative structure reminded me a lot of Fellini's I VITELLONI, with a series of character-building vignettes that appear to step away from the central plot (not unlike MEAN STREETS in that regard), and I'm sure that many fans of Scorsese's later work will be annoyed by this. A shame, because it's the type of storytelling that I sorely miss and that has been largely absent in cinema since the early 70s. His use of music here is also very interesting, and the songs he chose - most of it consisting of hits from Scorsese's youth - are inspired, to say the least.<br /><br />If you're a fan of character driven dramas, I highly urge you to see this picture. Also, if you're an aspiring filmmaker, this is an absolute must-see. With any luck, the newly restored DVD (which looks amazing) will inspire some up-and-coming directors to kick their careers off with a similarly personal and interesting feature debut."
22286_0,"Interesting camera-work is the main attribute of this late 1940s western. It plays and looks more like a film noir than a western, but there is nothing wrong with that. I enjoyed that aspect, especially the film noir-like cinematography. I say the latter because of all the stark black-and-white contrasts, night scenes and facial closeups. At the same time, it reminded me of a John Ford western with the expansive skies and big rock formations.<br /><br />I can't say the story is anything special. It's almost frustrating, seeing everyone chase after Robert Mitchum even though the man has nothing wrong! Yes, it's a paranoid viewer's delight but it got to be a little much of a downer for me. However, Mitchum, Teresa Wright, Judith Anderson, Dean Jagger and company all acted well, and I appreciated their talents."
22330_0,"If you like drama, there's not enough of it in this movie to intrigue you. If you like suspense, you'll certainly not suspend your nap as this movie ""progresses."" If you appreciate science fiction, there's precious little science and even less imaginative fiction to warrant watching this mess. In other words: this movie has nothing for everyone.<br /><br />Spunky Candace Cameron Bure (she played the oldest daughter in the TV series, ""Full House."") plays Katie English, a somewhat rebellious child (she can't even act rebellious), is repeatedly abducted by aliens, draws some pictures of it, and yells at her mother (the lovely Markie Post). But Mother, after being hypnotized, recognizes these tell-tale signs in her daughter, including puncture marks that looked like they were inflicted by a tri-fanged vampire, that remind her of her own alien abductions. There's a lot of crying, arguing, yelling, etc., and the movie deftly meanders, whining forth for over 2 hours.<br /><br />Our little ""Rebel"" also prances atop a figurative soapbox a couple of times, spouting environmental doomsday pap. This has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the movie, but was apparently put there for the viewers ""benefit"" and ""education."" This 1995 script has Katie telling her classmates how ""civilization as we know it"" will collapse by the year 2000 (The same drivel that teachers back in 1980 told children would happen before 1990; the same claptrap that's vomited in classrooms across America today).<br /><br />Finally the viewer gets to see the aliens. These entities are the quintessential mouthless, big-eyed, naked, mind-communicating creatures we've come to expect. But that's okay, they're a welcome relief in the movie. Yes, they're a welcome relief, but they are, however, rather incompetent scientists: they can't get their experiments right. But nonetheless I couldn't help but feel sorry for them for having repeatedly abducted such crybabies as specimens. In fact, I kept hoping they'd abduct me so that I wouldn't have to finish watching this horrible movie.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you neither rent the video release, nor watch this movie should it again rear it's boring head on TV."
22376_0,"WARNING: My brief comment on this film may contain a spoiler, so please don't read if you don't want your curiosity to be ruined.<br /><br />This made-for-TV movie about The Great One was brilliantly done, but I felt that whoever cast Brad Garrett (of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" fame) in the role of Jackie Gleason made a poor choice. In my opinion, John Goodman should've been picked for this particular role because he definitely had Gleason's build and look. Don't get me wrong--Garrett did a good job, but Goodman would've carried that role VERY far.<br /><br />This movie covered Gleason's childhood years in a broken home, his stand-up comedy career, his marriage and his various infidelities, as well as his early days in television up until the time of ""The Honeymooners""; but what the film didn't cover (but should have) was his later life beyond ""The Honeymooners"" and his major Hollywood works, from the tearjerker ""Gigot"" (one of my all-time favorite films) to the hilarious ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movies.<br /><br />This film would have merited a rating a ten from me, but I gave it a seven because of the casting choice of Brad Garrett and the film's failure to show us the complete career of Jackie Gleason, who will always be The Great One in the hearts of his many fans."
22420_0,"MTV, in its seeming quest to find the absolute bottom of the barrel, has certainly outdone itself with this truly depressing series on the lifestyles of the rich and unimportant. Why in the world would the parents of these foul and obnoxious children ever want their complete failure at child rearing put on television? Whenever I have accidentally channel- surfed into one of these episodes, it's like seeing an awful car wreck. It catches your interest for a couple minutes and then you realize just how utterly tragic it is and you have to stop watching. These rude and ill-bred teenagers are completely clueless to the fact that arrogance, ostentatious parties and expensive cars won't make them any less ""tacky"". There is not one birthday girl, or boy, on this show that isn't overly indulged and undeserving ""trailer trash""...spoiled, stupid and totally without any real ""class"". They all seem to be sad, needy and very shallow. The really cool people with mega-wealth don't need to show it off. On second thought, could MTV be featuring these screwed-up and nasty kids as a public service so the rest of us can avoid them? Ya, right!"
22466_0,"The original pre-cert videotape of this changes hands for crazy money these days, it's very very rare. I was 'fortunate' enough to get hold of a DVD-R of this, as it sounded right up my street...<br /><br />And the verdict?.....Jeeez! As noted previously, this is definitely ""inspired"" by 'Last House On The Left"" but the tone is totally different. It's proper early-70s rough-ass grindhouse business, sexist as hell, dumb, with sub-porno standard acting. It's not disturbing in the slightest however, and whilst the subject matter (rape rape and more rape) is nasty, the way it's done is just funny. The soundtrack is absolutely wild - incoherent hippy wailing over acoustic guitar meandering, you couldn't make it up, honestly. Has to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />This is a great period piece...the work of anonymous drunken old hacks exploiting the hippy counterculture. God knows who any of the people involved in this are, but hell, I'd be fascinated to know how and why a movie like this came about. Worth seeing to sate your curiosity...this film is one of a kind. It is DEFINITELY bad though."
22510_0,"A New Years Party on the top of a plush abandoned building. A group of spoiled success types(..rock singer, newspaper columnist, television exec, celebrity cook, entertainment lawyer, high-maintenance slut)find themselves trapped in the isolated wings of the abandoned building after following a riddle to a properly prepared party by a psycho. The psycho haunts the rooms, hidden behind his prey who wander aimlessly trying to survive as he captures them one by one when certain individuals make the mistake of getting separated. Booby traps await equipped with riddles. A list containing the names of the group given an invite are labeled with specific titles(Kathy-loser, Nicole-heartless, Adam-pig, etc)and when each victim is dispatched a red X is marked through them. The killer's weapon of choice is a hook. But, other methods of execution include used an ax splitting the forehead, end of a knife stabbing a hole in the neck, a sliced throat, heart removed from a chest with it beating in the killer's hand(..not elaborated in grisly detail, the director uses sounds, only displaying the beating heart), the back of a victim's head crushed repeatedly into the floor during a scuffle, and a vicious attack with a meat tenderizer. The gore-murders lack bite and slasher fans who watch this genre passionately will find them merely adequte. This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other. The characters like to insult each other constantly, fighting often over superficial stuff..their antics are at times playful, other instances nasty. Regardless, the killer couldn't plunge the hook into their gullets fast enough for me..but, alas, we spend a great deal of time longer with these sleazy egomaniacs which is unfortunate. There's of course a twist(..does the killer have a partner in crime?), but ""Steel Trap"" is little more than a tired Saw retread set in a building that lacks atmosphere, no matter how often the lights blink on and off. The killer should be creepy, but he's merely a walking kill-device whose motives for committing these acts is embarrassingly uninspired. Some slasher fans might get a kick out of who's *really* behind this mind trap, as the film closes with a warped comic tone mimicking cooking shows. The riddles used in the film are corny instead of witty, leading the characters in a maze of doors and rooms with the killer knowing exactly where to strike almost at all times."
22556_0,"I love science. I am not a scientist, but when it comes to books, magazines, etc., I am more likely to pick up something about science than anything else. I also love movies, so when a movie about Science comes along, I will see it.<br /><br />I am not anti-religion. If it helps you get through life, then I am all for it. I prefer Effexor myself, but whatever floats your boat is OK with me as long as you don't try to teach my children your fantasies.<br /><br />This is what it's all about. The fantasy of Creationism versus the facts of Evolution. This film makes it simple to understand even for the uneducated dodos that let others do their talking and thinking for them. It is even-handed and gives time to both sides of this non-debate.<br /><br />The Creationists want to promote ""teaching the controversy."" This film is perfect for that and should be shown in all schools and all classes."
22600_0,"I just saw this film earlier this evening at the Florida Film Festival, & in my 4 years of attending the festival this was one of the best I've ever seen. Character-driven stories such as these can be very difficult to pull off successfully; you will either care about the characters or you won't. This one succeeded in spades. Beautiful dialogue (even the meaningful pauses), sound, editing, characterization, all of it, simply beautiful.<br /><br />After the film ended there was a short Q&A with the director, Eric Byler. When that was over I was able to do something that most of us will never get a chance to do...to shake the director's & thank him for making such a wonderful movie. It was definitely my privilege to have seen this film."
22646_0,"I noticed that several people have given this film a 10/10 (!!?) rating...they could ONLY be the people who stand to make any money trying to rig this vote... Anybody who who pays to view this flick is gonna feel very ripped off. This is one of the worst i've ever tried to sit through. Thora Birch (in a small, ridiculous bit part) is the only actor with any talent in it -but i would have forced the producers to remove my name if i'd had anything to do with this film. I'm still tring to figure out why anybody made this and what the point was. Features the most pathetic attempt at slick film-making i've ever seen."
22691_0,"I hadn't seen this show until it was repeated on Dave. I became aware of it after seeing The Comedy Store Players, a group of comedians which includes Josie Lawrence.<br /><br />I enjoy the unpredictability of Whose Line is it Anyway and the diversity of the performers. The fact that the show had both English and American comedians made it better.<br /><br />The best performance ever had to be when Josie Lawrence and Caroline Quentin sung a duet about a beached whale. Admitedly that description may not sound funny, but if you've seen it you'll know how good it was.<br /><br />Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles were a great double act. They were particularly good at the round where they were given two completely random lines to incorporate into a sketch.<br /><br />Other improv shows such as Mock The Week are good, but Whose Line is it Anyway will always be the king of Improvised Comedy shows"
22736_0,"I heard varying comments prior to watching this film, and I have to say that I shall always follow my gut instinct from now on. This film is neither boring or slow paced! Whilst watching the trailers the first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful sets. And they did not disappoint! The set is magical. The acting is flawless. The music is brilliant. The story is well written, nicely paced and very artistic indeed. Clever and intellectual. A well deserved round of applause for both those in front of the scenes and behind. For anyone who has loved someone unconditionally. I would highly recommend to those who enjoyed films from Romeo and Juliet to Devdas to Moulin Rouge! ;)"
22781_0,"<br /><br />I just finished seeing Fulltime Killer. What a pleasant surprise. 2 months ago, I was sorely disappointed with the flicks that H.K churned out. Apparently, i was tired of watching every action directors in H.K imitating Tsui Hark, John Woo, Ringo Lam, and Johnny To. Every movie I saw, there was that typical shaky cameras, and sweeping movements, making everything seemed cooler than it actually is. Even the Greats imitated themselves in such mess as Zu Warriors. But then I saw Shaolin Soccer, and that shook my disturbed belief a bit. And today, I saw Fulltime Killer, and my faith in H.K is fully restored. I know that Fulltime Killer is nothing original, compared to the action classics such as ""the Killer"", but it was done right for once. I found myself lost in Johnny To's perspective of this excellent story. In the end, I took what seemed like the first breath since the opening of the film. Apparently I had a very good time. I was certainly pleasantly surprised. I found that every actors did their jobs well. Andy Lau, who always seemed a bit feminine to me fit the role well, and made it work. I was impressed with Takeshi's performance. Although his role seemed very stereotypical and slightly less demanding, he made it work well. I found myself in awe with Kelly Lin's portrayal of the innocent girl. The action scenes were very well done. Although they were noting revolutionary as the recent films ""crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""time and Tide"", but I found them incredibly effective. The Music was certainly the highlight of the film. Its haunting theme weave in well with the scenes, and made them alive. All in All.... not the most original, but at this day and age, it's almost impossible to find originality. Very fun time, and quite a pleasant surprise."
22826_0,"Plan 9 From Outer Space by the notorious filmmaker Ed Wood was so bad it was good, a laugh a-minute because it was intended to be serious. Sure, the acting was atrocious, and some of the sets were hysterical, but that's what makes it so unbelievably hilarious even today. ""Walk Like a Man"" can't hold a candle to the film-making wizardry that is Plan 9 From Outer Space. The wannabe comedic antics appear like they were written by a seven-year-old who overdosed on Ovalteen or a college freshman who took one too many hits of Metamucil on a Saturday night! The result is a movie that is supposed to be comedy that instead of making you laugh makes you cringe as every pathetic line that tries to be funny is outdone by an even more pathetic line. I mean, just when you think the movie can't get any worse, it passes all expectation by becoming even more unbelievably stupid by the minute.<br /><br />The relatively impressive cast of Christopher Lloyd and Cloris Leachman. cannot save this bottom of the barrel embarrassment masquerading as a movie. I've seen first graders write stuff more clever than this. The ""lines"" of dialog, which seem more akin to banter at a college fraternity party than a written script are just about as bad as they come. The writers must have worked very hard to come up with the worst jokes and cliché lines that Hollywood has ever attempted. <br /><br />The only thing more ridiculous than the movie itself is the premise. A family strikes it rich in the gold country, and as they are driving their sled through the snow back to civilization, they ""accidentally"" lose their youngest son! Well, it looks like he's pushed off the sled by his older brother so he can have more of the gold they discovered! Twenty-eight years later, the brother, nicknamed Bobo, is discovered by an animal scientist among a pack of wolves, but he doesn't act as much like a wolf as the filmmakers want you to believe. Actually wolves have a certain reserved dignity about them. The guy who thinks he's a wolf really isn't acting like a wolf at all, more like a deranged bull dog who scratches himself in funny parts of his body, if he's not licking new acquaintances on their chins. I don't buy that the wolves would have accepted this guy either! I think the wolves took one look at him and went, ""Get this creep out of here!""<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd plays, or maybe barely animates, the brother (the one who pushed him off the sled 28 years earlier) who is a cross between Scrooge and Atilla the Hun. He has tons of money from the inheritance of the gold, we presume, and this slothful impetuous monster is hated by everyone. He makes Bertie Wooster (of Jeeves and Wooster) appear like an intellectual saint. Not even his mother, Cloris Leachman, shows much love but rather appears to be on the verge of either slipping into a coma, or becoming a cat, a fate not unlike her ""wolfish"" grandchild! Instead of taking care of herself, she dotes on her kitties! The plot revolves around whether or not the ""canine"" brother can inherit his part of the money, or else stay like a, er, ""wolf"", I guess. Or is he more like a dog who thinks he's a wolf? Or is it the other way around?<br /><br />When Bobo finally ""comes home"" and starts licking Christopher Lloyd's face off, it became clear to me that the projector lights may be on but nobody's home. Or maybe this ""movie"" is a few screwballs short of a funny farm. On ""Sneak Previews"", the original show featuring film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, they always had a ""dog of the week"", usually a film so outrageously embarrassing that it earned a quick loving remark at the end of the show. This movie gets my vote for the dog of the century, in more ways than one."
22871_0,I cant believe I am not the only one who remembers this awesome movie. I have told others about it over the years and now one else remembers it. I was only 8 years old and cried harder than I had ever cried before when I saw this movie. I have been searching like the rest of you. I wish we could find it on DVD. I loved this movie and obviously it had an impact on so many of us if after all these years we all still remember it and are still searching for it. Could there be a way to locate which studio made this movie and beg for release on DVD? Wasn't the woman played by Kay Lenz??? I think but am not sure..I was only eight years old after all.
22916_0,The movie could have been executed better even though a novel idea. The movie was a bit of a drag for me because as an Indian I already know the stark contrast between the kind of people who travel to the US. So it maybe an eye-opener for a foreigner but nothing new for me. The ending was the worst. They should have just probably ended with the WTC coming down. Konkana Sen traveling from Boston to LA???? Wow!!! its like 8 hrs by flight!!!! By bus it will be forever!!!! And she never bothers to contact her hubby for the days she was traveling??? WT????? Also direction wise it looked sloppy and un-professional as if I was watching it as part of an amateur film festival. Not expected out of a man of the stature of Mr. Shah.
22961_0,"While it may be argued that the picture presents an extremely liberal viewpoint on the causes of teenage crime, it is nonetheless an excellent film. <br /><br />John Derek, as Nick Romano, is absolutely fabulous in the lead role. He is certainly depicted here as a victim of society. When his father dies in prison, after being sent there due to shoddy work by his attorney, Derek becomes embittered and turns to crime. The reform school is shown as a place that hardens this young man.<br /><br />He meets his Juliet and for a time things are looking up until the lure of the streets, his inability to handle a job, the poor company he keeps and the crowd that he runs around with, all lead to tragedy.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart is equally impressive in the role as the attorney for Nick. His impassioned plea for mercy at the end of the film is done extremely well.<br /><br />Look for Sid Melton as a young hood with a variety of marvelous supporting performances, especially that of George MacReady as a relentless prosecuting attorney."
23005_0,"To me, this is/was the best television programme ever - simple as.<br /><br />There's something about BNO that has stuck with me since I first saw it in the early nineties. It was cheaply made, a minimal cast, yet for that it was honest and ridiculously hilarious. It has a natural funniness that I've just not seen on anything since - it just didn't try too hard, it was just that funny.<br /><br />But as a couple of reviewers have said here, either you get it or you don't - there is absolutely no middle ground. You won't 'half' like it. It is truly silly - but intelligent at the same time. Part of its humour is the way lots of different comedy concepts are seamlessly included - verbosity, falling over, sarcasm - it works on many levels. But there you go - I'm over-analysing.<br /><br />Just watch it; if you don't find it funny, you've lost nothing. But if you do, you might have just discovered what you'll see as the funniest thing ever."
23050_0,This is the second time my wife and I have viewed this film and we think it's a perfect Christmas film. It's heart-warming and can be viewed by the whole family. I hope in the near future that it is released on video as I would love to purchase a copy for my very own (that's my Christmas Wish).
23096_0,"F*ck is a very entertaining and interesting documentary describing the use and abuse of the word in the English language. Of course, the word is used many times and in many ways (noun, verb, etc.). Experts discussing their experience with the word f*ck include liberals, conservatives, a 'cunning linguist', comedians, porn stars and Miss Manners.<br /><br />The film is balanced and informative. It shows how positive energy is released while using the word f*ck. As well, discussed are appropriate ways to express frustration and copulation. Further, F*ck, offers a new swear word: ""Boone"", as in Pat Boone, who shines as an expert is verbal repression.<br /><br />At Hotdocs film festival 2006, where I saw this film, the audience received it very well and everybody begins discussing and giggling again as they leave the theater. This is the kind of movie you see and imagine discussions on other similar words."

23186_0,"This isn't as good of a film as Boys Town, but then most sequels don't live up to the original. Mickey Rooney gives a refreshingly toned-down portrayal of an older, more mature Whitey Marsh, and of course Spencer Tracy fits right back into the role of Father Flanagan. A bit idealistic and old-fashioned, but perhaps that is exactly what draws me to films like these? Any fan of classic movies, Spencer Tracy, Mickey Rooney, or all of the above will have a nice time watching this movie."
23230_0,"If you love what now would be called 'red-band' trailers (the greats ones that don't skimp on the good stuff, be it any of the three B's: blood, boobs, and/or bush), this compilation of trailers for low-budget 'grindhouse' movies is definitely for you. True, a small handful of the trailers are useless (thankfully relegated closely to the end, such as 'Superfuzz', and one or two others), but for the most part this collection is superb. Not one, not two, but three Christina Lindberg trailers with her in her FULL glory, if you catch my drift. (God she's stunning), The Hammer when he was still at the top of his game as 'Boss N*gger', campy gay bike riders, and a ton of nudity, gore and violence are just a few of the delightfully high points. Of course this is not really for everyone, but anyone who wants a trip down memory lane or just wants to see how good trailers used to be, rent this ASAP. You will NOT be disappointed."
23276_0,"The Amazing Race is one of if not the best Reality shows on TV. The premise is simple, 11 teams of 2 begin a race around the world for 1 million dollars the race is broken into legs in each episode and each team must compete various task through the leg before they can continue on to the pit stop, the team that finishes last in each leg is usually eliminated (although some legs are non-elimination.) When there are three teams left they race the final leg to win the cash prize. The show is fascinating to watch as the teams race from country to country and many run into obstacles during a leg such as a delay of a flight at the airports or a cab driver who gets lost. The tasks during the race varies if a team is unable to complete a task they will be assessed a penalty and can't check in until the time is up. The race is fun to watch as you learn about different cultures and sightseeing throughout the show. who will win? You have to tune in to find out. Have fun watching, the world is waiting for you."
23320_0,"This was an 'Olsen Twins Movie.' It seems like all of their movies are the same. Twins with different personalities, a basic plot that was probably created by a 5 year old, and a mushy ending with the girls loving each other. Same old thing. They should have just called it ""Yep, another movie by us with the same story, but we have different names!"" Okay, enough on how they are total repeaters. My favourite part of the movie (besides the credits indicating to me it was over) was when Simple Plan was in it. Simple Plan are one of my favourite bands, but I was really disappointed that out of all of them, there was only one line and that was <br /><br />""Lomax?"" said by Chuck. Come on! Really now, and did anyone notice that security was so tight, even though Levy's character had a police badge that he couldn't get it, but Jane got in no problem and the security lifted her right on to the stage? Come on. Once I found out the basic plot to the story I knew how it would end. And Roxy with the the whole Avril Lavigne speech. Lame. I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10, but I gave it a 2 because Simple Plan was there to take the spotlight off of MK and A. Seriously, anyone notice with the more movies they do, the less other characters they have in them? (Barfs in mouth) 2 out of 10"
23366_0,"I first saw this DVD about three weeks ago - nestling in the bargain bin in Morrison's supermarket.<br /><br />It was cheap t £2.99...though the packaging looked anything but: and the striking image on the front of the box interested me. Two Korean Soldiers...with different uniforms, stood in front of the massive turbo-prop of an American fighter. I didn't buy it at the time but it registered within my weary , troubled mind.<br /><br />The word 'Dongmakgol' stayed with me and I remembered to check it out on the internet movie database - a brilliant resource for film fans.<br /><br />I took the plunge a fortnight later & added it to my collection... ... I've now watched this movie twice in the space of four days. What can I say? Well, it has a most marvellous musical score...which I thought I'd heard before. As time went by I realised it's the same music used in Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'....which I think was shot before 'Dong' but I'm, not sure...we might have a chicken and egg situation here because the films are, in my opinion of equal merit...and I loved 'Ryan' and its message with a similar evangelical zeal.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who does not mind subtitling and are prepared to invest a couple of hours and more into the cinematic experience then I'd urge you to buy this little masterpiece. I say 'little' but it isn't really...everything about this production says big-time to me. I do not know how vibrant or productive the Korean film industry is but if this example is anything to go by I need to find out more.<br /><br />Set during the Korean war it tells the tale of some disaffected troops from either side. The Communist north, and the 'puppet' army (according to the commies) from the south who are being aided and abetted by western forces. It's September 1950.<br /><br />By chance the stragglers find themselves ensconced in a small village, both isolated and remote. It's people are hitherto untouched by war , or indeed much of the outside world. Some of the English used in the captions is quite comical, and there are several smile out loud moments - if that makes any sense. There is also violence, and graphic death by gunfire. All of which is essential to the telling of the story. The contrasting nature of the worlds in collision here...from peaceful serenity and unconditional humanity, to brute force and ignorance.<br /><br />The innocence and naivety of the villagers is captured by the film's female lead. A delightful teenager who wafts in and out of scenes with flowers in her hair and wide eyed with a simple outlook on life. She's not quite 'the full shilling' yet somehow has a soothing, calming effect on almost everyone she meets. Her sweet, innocent face is a picture of all you'd want to celebrate in this often worrying world.<br /><br />Also taking refuge in the village is the downed pilot of a UN recconaisance aircraft....brilliant 'crash' scenes incidentally...gut wrenchingly terrifying.<br /><br />The hostility between the groups is tangible for a while, and an incident with a hand grenade results in the total destruction of the villagers food store. The film constantly surprised the unwary. They all pledge to helping the locals replenish stocks...as winter is fast approaching.<br /><br />The six who form the warring factions form an uneasy alliance as the story moves on. The simple life of the villagers, and the life they lead soon starts to lull the protagonists into believing they've been there for years! They are welcomed to Dongmakgol.Smiles abound, friendships are forged and the incomers weave their way into the tapestry of village life. Especially after helping overcome a quite terrifying wild boar...this sequence was stunning, yet simplistic and I realised I was watching a master film maker open mouthed in near wonderment. How I enjoyed watching my wife view the same scenes a day or two later...she too was captivated.<br /><br />The good times cannot last of course and soon paratroops are invading the area ahead of a bombing raid which threatens to annihilate the village and everyone in it. Sacrifice is called for , and the recent arrivals are not found wanting in what amounts to a fitting, poignant climax to a memorable movie. What now emerges is a band of brothers newly united in a common cause.<br /><br />This is the first Korean film I've seen , it perhaps will not be the last. I loved almost every moment of it & have elevated it toward the near top of my league...yes! it really is that good."
23410_0,"Gosh. Here's a film that not only went directly to video, but horror of horrors, it was directly to Blockbuster.<br /><br />And yet it is precisely in the center of one of the six nodes of film perfection. Its that place where cinematic qualities recede and theatrical drama of the Chekov variety is delivered: should in conflict; souls in pain; souls striving toward some sort of tentative peace, knowing that each balance is forged personally.<br /><br />Now that Mangella has died, taken from us early, I appreciate him. He made a commercial excrescence in ""Cold Mountain,"" but there are elements of his other films that show a delicate soul behind the noise. Here he is himself, directing something he has conceived, and brought into the world.<br /><br />Its a marvel of tension. He has two mothers, each struggling alone with ""special"" children. Two children who are addicted to gymnastic life beyond what is healthy and reasonable. Tow enterprises to clean the city, one using trees, the other sensitive policing. <br /><br />Two themes of ethnic cleansing.<br /><br />In other words, two haunting worlds that swirl around our focus, the one who draws, creates models, makes photos on a MacBook. This character is played by Jude Law. He's not who I would have chosen to play this man who manages four balancing acts, all connected to each other. I just don't think he is an interesting enough soul to speak to us about these sorts of things. He's basically a child himself in these matters.<br /><br />It almost doesn't matter, because Mangella fills in the void with cinematic ambiguities. There are deleted scenes on this DVD that should, really absolutely have been in the final cut. Why they were not baffles me. Would it lessen the commercial value of the thing? One involves a coworker, a women apparently worth exploring, who Law's character considers. That he backs off makes his subsequent leap all the more forceful.<br /><br />The two women here are played by real actresses.

23456_0,"I had some trepidation watching HellBent, as I'd not seen a slasher film before. Fortunately, the film didn't prove realistic enough to provoke anything more than a startled gasp or two from me. But worst than that is the absolute unbelievability of the four leads in their roles. If writer-director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts had cast more talented actors willing to imbue their characters with the slightest bit of believability as WeHo gay guys, this movie might have had some credibility as the ""first gay slasher"" movie. I can't help wondering if any of these actors been around 20something West Hollywood gays in their lives? I defy anyone with an ounce of ""gaydar"" to detect anything queer about any of the lead characters (the drag queen least of all). Yes, there are ""straight acting"" gay guys, and there are straight guys. It seems that the four lead actors were doing their best to send out signals to the audience, ""We're just pretending. We wouldn't want anyone to think we might possibly be gay."" Try again, Mr. Etheredge-Ouzts, only this time respect your audience's intelligence and perceptiveness."
23500_0,"A sheriff(John Schneider, really stuck with some corner one liners when he blasts the monsters)must contend with several large crocodiles which are eating locals. His past lady-love, Helen(Sarah Lafleur), an animal conservationist, along with an egotistical wealthy hunter(Sam McMurray)and his sidekick Ahmed(Joe Holt)will assist the sheriff in his duties to take each croc out. They try to pry knowledge about these crocs from Sadie Bickerman(Cloris Leachman, the only thing that works in this film is her nasty loathsome character who loves the crocs more than people)who loves her ""babies"" and seems unwilling to give them jack squat. Making matters worse is that the sheriff's son(Chad Collins), and his love-interest Kerri(Alice Ziegler)are fending for their lives after a couple of the crocs devoured their high school pals.<br /><br />Leave it to the always reliable Sci-Fi Channel to drop another rotten giant monster movie of low quality in our laps..this one having the misfortune of being a sequel to the entertaining B-movie that came out year back from writer David E Kelley and director Steve Minor. While that film had a very enjoyable cast consisting of Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt & especially scene-stealing Betty White(..Chloris plays Betty's sister in the sequel), this sequel has no-names with limited ability to even convey a minuscule of charm. It could be because the dialogue is so laughable and special effects so poor. How can anyone, much less Schneider proclaim the quip, ""Afterwhile, Crocodile!""and make it work?"
23546_0,"I'm always a little bit suspicious of made-for-TV movies, but this is a good one. It's an excellent script and good directing--plus everyone turns in an excellent performance. Rudolph Martin is especially terrific as Vlad Dracula, and Christopher Brand makes Bruno a very striking character. Jane Marsh comes across as very delicately beautiful, and the kids are unusually convincing. Roger Daltrey does an excellent transition from middle-aged to old, and Peter Weller emits no clue to give away the ending. There's great support from the supporting cast.<br /><br />The producers have handled the subject extremely well, considering how much gore they could have spilled, and it turns out to be an intense, dramatic movie. It investigates the characters and suggests how they were warped by the times and politics, and also touches on the metaphysical implications of such viciousness. They've let up a little too much at the end, I think, and tried to skew the whole thing so it looks like a romance--would have been better to end it with just a shot of the castle.<br /><br />"
23591_0,"This is a real diamond in the dirt. The kind of movie that gets out to video too soon due to marketing failure. I saw this on video and thought that it was one of the best gangster movies I've seen, ever... You've got to give the best credit to the casting - Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Robin Wright-Penn, Ed Harris, Nick Turturro - whoever did this piece of work was really ahead of their time. The action sequences are stunning and realistic. To summarize this movie - probably the most 'atmospheric' modern gangster movie since the Godfather."
23636_0,"I never really had any true friends when I was growing up (I was weird, okay), but I know that the best friends are the ones who stay around. ""Queens Logic"", an under-looked , sleeper indie film (unless you look really hard in the discount DVD bins) starring a name cast, proves that in the largest borough of New York City.<br /><br />Wedding jitters plague Ray (Ken Olin of ""thirtysomething"" and a producer of ""Alias""), since he's a talented painter born and residing in Queens, and is about to marry longtime sweetheart Patty (Chloe Webb) a hairdresser with a philosophical outlook. His other pals from childhood, fish marketer cousin Al (the talented Joe Mantegna of ""Criminal Minds""), Al's right-hand man Eliot (John Malkovich of ""Changeling""), visiting musician Dennis (Kevin Bacon) and working actor Vin (Tony Spiridakis, who co-wrote the film with Joey Savino) help him out by throwing a decent bachelor's party (men and women invited), but they each have their problems.<br /><br />Despite his jester charm, Al's Peter Pan persona irritates his frustrated wife Carla (the sexy Linda Fiorentino); Eliot's a homosexual who has no desire to play ""the love game""; Dennis's still struggling on making it big in Los Angeles and Vin gets one-night stands but no romance. Adulthood: IT SUCKS! But not this film.<br /><br />Director Steve Rash (""The Buddy Holly Story"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and the two DTV sequels to ""Bring It On"") is competent, but the actors help out more, pumping the tale with humanity, especially Mantegna's breezy, arrested development demeanor, Malkovich's non-stereotypical attitude and Webb's down to earth perspective. Also entertaining is Jamie Lee Curtis as a high society dame, who gives Al a lesson about maturity in a colorful way, and rocker Tom Waits as a grave-voiced but likable lowlife associate of the gang. Look for a pre- ""Will & Grace"" Megan Mullany as a drunken conquest of Vin's. The film's soundtrack is littered with rock and disco tunes from the 1970s, the decade the guys grew up.<br /><br />Likable, poignant, sly, funny and a love letter to its' backdrop (Queens's Hellgate Bridge is prominent here), ""Queens Logic"" reminds us, despite how we grow up or wherever we are in our lives, the neighborhood we grew up is part of us and vice versa, and the best friends we have reminds us of that."

23726_0,"There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're crap. This would be one of the latter. Utterly devoid of a single redeeming quality (unless you count non-celebrity nudity), Anarchy TV is the unfunniest comedy ever made. And considering that cable access TV is such a haven for oddballs that this thing should write itself, that's almost something of an achievement. This atrocity aims for the broadest targets imaginable (Are ya ready? How abouttelevangelism!) in the most unimaginative way possible (the Fundamentalist Christian TV network is called Christian Unity Network Television; one scan of those initials will give you a taste of the level of comedy genius at work here). It is populated mainly by unknowns, or has-beens (and even they seem like they're slumming). In a characteristically brilliant scene, an assassination attempt on a main character, broadcast on the station, infuriates the viewing public so much they, in a show of solidarity, smash their TVs.

23861_0,"Claude Chabrol, the French director of many thrillers and dramas and other genres, is at his best when subtly but forcefully pulling the rug out from the viewer. This isn't your usual case of a romance story criss-crossed with a serial killer thriller. In fact, we're not made very much aware that there is a serial killer- save for a few mentions here and there- until halfway through the movie, and by the time we are it's full-throttle in a kind of expertly manipulated suspense, not in the usual sense but through an ominous musical score by Pierre Jansen and a movement of fluidity with the camera that tells the story sort of conventionally but not at the same time. It's a small, master's class in subverting the genre by making us care so much about the characters even as we know they're doomed from the happy opening.<br /><br />That's not to say that Chabrol has made anything that can't be enjoyed by one looking for a good entertaining thriller first and foremost. If anything the opening of the movie is what lures one in perfectly, as it's a very jovial in this wedding sequence one sees guests school-teacher Helene (Stephane Audran, Chabrol regular) and butcher Paul (Jean Yanne, perfect as the butcher), enjoying themselves and making good conversation. This stretches out into the first half of the film; a friendship develops around food that Paul brings over, and it's only when Paul thinks its time to go the 'next step' that he's told it can't be because of a past horrible relationship that Helen faced- horrible in the sense of disappointment. There's a disconnect emotionally that is left open, thus, going into the second half of the film, where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for: the serial killer plot.<br /><br />There's a string of murders involving women, and one of them- the bride from the opening- is a shocker not exactly for the revelation itself, per-say, but how Chabrol builds up to it. At first it's seen as the most suspenseful thing in the film so far as Helen leads her class along a mountainside and stops to have lunch. The music is playing right here, and it's really chilling for how simple it lays out the tension, like a weirdo standing across the street in a black cloak acting suspicious but, at the same time, too subtle to pin down. This adds to the sudden shock, then, after the music stops and finally the reveal happens via blood dripping on the kid's sandwich. This, however, is just one example of Chabrol's calm mastery as a director of the material.<br /><br />It would be one thing to go on and on about the eerie absorption of the camera-work, which goes between conventional stylization (for a French film of the period) and poetic editing and framing. Or to go on and on about the stunning work turned by Audran (going between an entire emotional palette, as it were, from happy to sobbing to frightened to pale and shot to hell) and Yanne (also great at what he's meant to be, our male protagonist and, sadly, eventual antagonist by default). But it's the emotional struggle that makes this compelling above all other good reasons to recommend.<br /><br />The Butcher posits a relationship that is platonic, naturalistic, and genuinely interesting; these aren't cookie-cutter characters but well-drawn and with things that make them identifiable even as they, early on, seem to go on about trivial things not related to the plot (a little like a Woody Allen movie). Then, when it switches gears bit by bit and the paranoia increases, by the time the climax comes it becomes very, ultimately, tragic. Chabrol goes to lengths to reveal, simply, the soul of a man one should not feel any sympathy for. That one close-up in the car ride to the hospital is one of the finest climaxes I might ever see in a movie from Europe, even anywhere. And damned if isn't representative of what Chabrol can do as a craftier but no less true-to-his-art member of the Cashier du cinema filmmaker club. A+"
23906_0,"Leonard Maltin is way off base on this one. He gave it one and a half stars and calls it an antique early talkie with a ""miscast"" Lew Ayres. Yes, it's an early talkie but it's a good one - as good if not better than SMART MONEY and on its way to being PUBLIC ENEMY just a year later. The story (the usual crime does not pay moral with some twists) is a good one, strong on character and deserved its Oscar nomination. Lew Ayres gives what I consider to be his best screen performance, as a young and intelligent crime boss. Cagney, sixth billed, is his henchman and here impresses no end - he is completely at home in the talkie medium with a performance full of nuances and naturalism. No wonder he headed right to the top.<br /><br />Louie Ricarno (Ayres) organizes the various hoods in his city into a conglomerate to protect each others' interests and eliminate gang wars, which profit no one. Once he has achieved this he retires to marry and raise his kid brother, currently in a military academy. One hitch here is that the woman he marries is also sweet on his henchman, Steve Mileaway (Cagney) and the feeling is returned. All goes well until the mob starts to break apart and tries to lure Louie back to the city by attempting to kidnap his young brother. The kidnap attempt goes awry and the boy is killed. Louie, now hardened more than ever, returns to the city, swearing vengeance. I won't reveal the rest of the plot, but it is well acted and well characterized. True, the direction is sluggish and the other actors are not up to the professionalism of Ayres and Cagney, but it must take its place with the other early crime melodramas (FIVE STAR FINAL, LITTLE CAESAR, PUBLIC ENEMY, G-MEN) as being top of the line."

The acting/dialogue as expected, is also a hoot - is there really anyone out there who can keep a straight face as the characters in these films interact with one another?!<br /><br />Added to this, the original film into which the ninja segments have been edited is also actually very good in it's own right and involves a skilled swordsman called eagle in a tale of violent retribution.<br /><br />All in all this is tremendous (and somewhat insane) fun!"
23997_0,"I went to see this movie, expecting to see a nice humorous action movie, but I was VERY disappointed when I left the cinema... They tried to make a funny movie, but the jokes were sooo easy even a 5 year would understand them and that's not my kind of humour. The first half of the movie didn't really contain a story, which can be OK (see ""Dude where's my car""), but in the second half they suddenly tried to make a story, in which they failed big time. <br /><br />Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious that you could see it coming 10 minutes in front, so after a while everything that happened started to annoy me. I was like ""I hope they won't let this happen"" and then a few seconds later it happened, bummer... for me, cuz some people seemed to enjoy themselves, which was even more annoying<br /><br />Conclusion: don't waste your money on this movie or, if your going to see it anyway, have a lot of beer before entering the cinema, it might work...."
24040_0,"...but it never did! It's actually good. Some very good acting, some very good, well-developed characters and a plot that you actually get involved in and care about. At first, it keeps looking like the kind of movie that's going to beat you over the head with every simplistic character motivation or plot point, but it doesn't. It actually leaves a lot unexplained, to great affect. Even the third act, in which many movies, even good ones, fall completely to pieces, is solid here. The 4.6 rating is really not fair, and is more about how much some people just DESPISE Stallone and anything he does, no matter what. I generally hate about 80% of what Stallone puts out, but when I like him, I like him a lot. And in this movie, he's good. Mickey Rourke is good (starts out strong but gets a little two dimensional as the movie develops, but that's OK, he's still fascinating to watch). John C. McGinley is John C. McGinley-good. Rachel Leigh Cook is very good, and actually great and very moving in one scene in particular. It's really not a bad movie at all."
24086_0,"During the first decades of the last century, the city of London was well-known for its many objects of local colour; to say London was to say Big Ben and by extension, the Houses of the Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the Queen Mother, the gin-tonic, the river Thames, the fog and Jack the Ripper.<br /><br />But the city's most infamous murderer did his work in the past, so the British film director Herr Alfred Hitchcock updated the celebrated story and created ""The Avenger"", his own mysterious assassin at large in London.<br /><br />""The Lodger; A Story of the London Fog"" (1927) is an excellent silent film and probably the best one made by Herr Hitchcock during his silent period. The film has all those ingredients and virtues one associates with Herr Alfred. This German count especially appreciates the masterful way the suspense is created, leading the audience down different tricky paths of mystery and intrigue. Besides the outstanding film narrative and excellent camera-work, there is also a good deal of wit: the Londoners, like any other European commoners, watch with fascination the story of this dangerous criminal who terrifies a whole population and defies the police. An added attraction are the appearances of many nice girls in negligees; what more is needed?<br /><br />There are a lot of scenes in ""The Lodger"" wherein Herr Hitchcock's talent for creating mysterious atmosphere is well demonstrated; the influence of German cinema-with which Herr Hitchcock was very familiar-is also apparent in his technique. Some admirers of Herr Hitchcock have told this Herr Von that themes common in later Hitchcock films can be noted in this one: blondes and fetishism, the sensual kiss between the lodger ( Herr Ivor Novello ) and Daisy ( Frau June ) and the scene in which the lodger wants to enter the bathroom where June is taking a bath. These will be developed and improved later by Herr Hitchcock during his talkie career, but this is a completely different story for this German count.<br /><br />And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take lodgings tonight with a Teutonic rich heiress.<br /><br />Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/"
24130_0,"I saw this movie in December of 1968 when it was first released in the US. I was in High School, had just turned 16. This movie was rated ""X"" (noone admitted under the age of 16). I remember it being somewhat disjointed. When I think about it, I can't help comparing it (loosly) to the ""Austin Powers"" type of film, except much racier! By todays standards quite tame. It seems so campy now, but what a cast!! I'm glad it's on DVD now; I'll watch it again. I started being a movie buff when I was very young. My uncle owned the ""63rd Street Drive-In Theatre"" in Kansas City, Mo. from the late 50's to 1998. So I'm quite well-versed in cinema history."
24176_0,"I really enjoyed this film. The handling of a legendary story was good. How the military can make mistakes was well handled, I liked the squaddie's flirtation with the cook. The way in which the ""rivals"" were united in rescuing the boy and hoping the water horse would make its escape to the sea, was good. All actors who took the part of Angus were superb, special effects were also superb and I recognised some of the locations. I sometimes wonder if there should be a ""target audience"" for films. This is the type of film which (like Night in the Museum) can appeal to all ages. It's a delight to watch something with no offensive language, (which, for me, spoils such films as Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones) and no incomprehensible transatlantic colloquialisms. Make more films like this please!!"
24220_0,"All I can say is THANK GOD FOR NETFLIX!!! I'm the type of cinephile who will buy a movie sight unseen if the filmmakers interest me or if it's a horror film that sounds interesting. In that sense ""Trapped Ashes"" fulfilled the criteria perfectly....<br /><br />I realized recently though that I really am wasting money buying movies unseen so I signed up with Netflix figuring that I could rent new releases that appealed to me & if I liked em' I would purchase em'. ""Trapped Ashes"" was a movie I was dying to see. How could it go wrong?? Russell, Cunninngham, Dante, Hellman & Gaeta (The rookie of the 5) each directing a segment of a horror film?? It's gotta rock...Doesn't it?? It doesn't rock. It's actually pretty much a complete failure. It plays like one of those softcore ""Horror"" movies that used to play on Showtime in the late 80's thru the mid 90's. Aside from some so-so effects in the first segment there is nothing to recommend this disaster at all.<br /><br />I returned it to Netflix on the same day I received it, Thankful for the money I saved by not purchasing it.

A great performance also came from Drew Barrymore as the waitress Julia Sullivan and cousin Holly Sullivan was portrayed well by Christine Taylor. The complete plot of the story is very original and hard to find in any other film which once again adds to the excellence of this classic. This film is definitely in my top five of favorites and in my opinion deserves more recognition and credit for its excellence."
24310_0,"One reason I enjoyed (and still enjoy) Robot Chicken is because it is so damn nostalgic, among other reasons. I thought it pulled both the obvious adult humor and just plain stupid humor, both which I enjoy (and relate too??!!). Anyways, its skits mimic that of MADTv, but more to the point, and more of an open ability to do what ever you want and can humanly do (IE; plastic vs people). The characters in this 'animation' are created primarily from plastic, allowing for an almost 'toy look', which especially reins in when a skit reflects that of a prior toy. Other skits don't touch on much of anything...well to do with anything, humor at that point becomes more personal then ever, as for myself, even those times where I don't quite understand the humor in that specific skit, I can understand what they are trying to relate too which further solidifies their attempt to connect to all audiences in some personal way. Cheers to Seth Green and Matthew Senreich, they know what type of humor some people enjoy and bring it to them non-stop during their brief twelve-minute segment."

24400_0,"It is much too easy to fall into the post-World War Two media trap that the war was a man's war, and that women were just incidental to the effort. Thank goodness there are movies like this to remind Americans that the war was a total effort by almost everyone. In a real sense, women have not yet received full honor for their contribution to the war effort, whether they were ferrying planes, tending wounded, of carrying intelligence. In this film, one finds the horrors of war go beyond the battle lines into the minds of those who faced the reality of a world weary and frightened of war. This movie is also a reminder that most Americans during the war saw the fall of Bataan and the Phillippines as the major tragedy of the time. Pearl Harbor was frightening enough, but the very magnitude of defeat in the Pacific brought home the reality that there would be more casualties--if they could get off the island. It is difficult to find a Colbert movie of this period where she did not excel as a actress. This movie is no exception, she is extraordinary. Also, the evacuation scene is spectacular. If this movie did not inspire the Homefront to greater effort, what could? World War Two was everyone's war, and the peace would be everyone's peace."

The pain on Uma's character's face is just too much to take sometimes. I've watched this film twice and even though the I knew what was going to happen, seeing it a second time was just as heart-wrenching and touching.

24536_0,"I was introduced to the ""X-Men"" as a kid in the 1990s when I started seeing episodes of the cartoon show. Later, I started playing an X-Men video game, and during my comic book phase, I do recall reading some X-Men ones. Since then, the comic book series has been one of several to get the live action movie treatment at some point within the past ten years or so. I didn't see too many films on the big screen back in 2000, so I didn't see this this first ""X-Men"" movie adaptation. I finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel, ""X2"", but I have now seen it more than once, and it is good.<br /><br />In the near future, many mutated humans exist. They are born with a special X-Factor gene, which gives each of them a certain superpower. Unfortunately, these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity, even though many of them mean no harm. In the X-Mansion, where many good mutants live, Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for students with the special X-Factor gene, where they learn how to use their gifts wisely. Xavier dreams of a society where mutants can live with the rest of humanity in peace. However, another mutant named Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto), who was once Xavier's friend, has different plans. He has a machine that can convert non-mutated humans, and he plans to speed up the process of human evolution with it! For some reason, one unbeknownst to anyone in the X-Mansion, Magneto and his evil mutants are after either Logan or Rogue, two recent arrivals at the mansion! <br /><br />Comic book movies from recent years are generally not known to be flawless, so it's no surprise that ""X-Men"" has some fairly weak moments. After the first scene, which is set in 1944, and the story skips to the near future, where the rest of the movie takes place, the film gets pretty shaky, starting with Rogue in her room with her boyfriend, just before she discovers her powers. I would say the story really gets good around the part when Logan (a.k.a. Wolverine) first finds himself in the X-Mansion. After that, it doesn't stay completely steady for the rest of the film, but usually is pretty entertaining, with a decent amount of action and suspense, as well as good special effects, some intriguing futuristic sets, and occasional humour. I can't say TOO many of the cast performances here really stand out, but those of Patrick Stewart (as Xavier), Ian McKellen (as Magneto), and Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine) do. The script isn't perfect, but for the most part, it's better than the ""Hulk"" and ""Catwoman"" scripts (two very disappointing comic book movies), that's for sure. Here, there's a mixture of strong and weak dialogue and acting.<br /><br />So, overall, this first ""X-Men"" movie does have its cheesy moments, but that certainly doesn't mean it has no entertainment value. Now, some people strongly dislike these recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, and if you're one of them, I'm sure saying that this one has its cheesy moments is a gross understatement to you, if you've seen it. However, if you don't like this kind of movie, it's simple, don't watch it. For those whose interest is often captured by comic book movies like this, there may be some films of this kind which are best to avoid, most notably the more poorly received ones, but ""X-Men"" certainly isn't one of those, even if it's not the best adaptation of a comic book series ever made."
24581_0,"This film was quite a pleasant surprise. I would recommend it to every one as it certainly is good cinema. A class above the stereotypical Bollywood genre you would normally expect out of South Asia, this Pakistani film explores the origins of religious fundamentalism in Pakistan along with the horrors following Partition that still scar the memories of many in the region. I would probably rate this above 1947 Earth and certainly consider it to be the most influential movies I have seen on Partition. Excellent camera work, fluent and appropriate use of Punjabi script and great top notch acting by Kiron Kher along with many veteran Pakistani actors will leave you full of emotion after you see the film. The subtitles could be a bit better for the Non-Punjabi viewer, and i think a little more spotlight should have been put on how and why the religious fundamentalist gathered such momentum in a nation leaning more towards Moderate rule after Bhutto's regime. The fact that these groups had strong economic and social backing from the U.S at the time, as they were the ones fighting the war against communist Russia should have been brought out more plainly for the viewer not familiar with the politics and history of the region at the time. And it is these same groups that received such full fledged support from the U.S at the time and painted as 'Holy Warriors' by the Western Media that are now considered terrorist organizations in the post 9/11 era. This point that the U.S played a vital hand in strengthening Islamic fundamentalist organizations under Zia's rule was i think not driven home to the extent it could have been. But all in all a wonderful first effort by Sabiha Sumar, i would give it a 9 out of 10."
24626_0,"First off, Jeff Goldblum is just awesome. Everything I've seen him in has been good, up to and including ""The Race for the Double Helix."" That being said, ""War Stories"" is just plain good. Good may in fact be an understatement. Sure, it isn't big on fleshing out, but it's a two hour telefilm, and like most movies, there isn't the time. We get a bit of backstory on the major characters, but the focus is more on the events that take place and how they affect the characters than understanding what makes the characters tick.<br /><br />Goldblum was the only member of the cast I recognized, but that isn't to say the others were bad. The actress who played opposite Goldblum, Lake Bell as Nora, I believe, was quite good, as were the other reporters. It was dramatic in parts, there was action, and I actually was totally uncertain of the outcome.<br /><br />Overall, ""War Stories"" kicked ass. It actually manages to weave a web of confusion together into a coherant, interesting story. It's one of the best made-for-tv movies I've seen in the past few years. It doesn't try to knock you over the head with a message, and it doesn't overplay any sort of 9/11 in an attempt to get pity viewership or something like that. It's just plain good."
24671_0,"This special feature from HBO a couple of years back was one of the best original programs ever done for the network. Worthy of PBS even. Taking the documented words of people who were enslaved in this country and having their comments read to us was a wonderful idea and gave viewers a more true insight for what the life of a slave was often like. It rips to pieces all of those ignorant assumptions over the years that slavery wasn't ""all that bad"". Only the worst kind of human being with a lack of education, common sense or human dignity could ever think such a thing in the first place. Unfortunately though there are many people out there who fit that category. It was a stroke of genius to pick a handful of well known black celebrities to put a face on the people whose words they were reading. Even better these celebrities, for the most part, were actors who had the ability to convey the emotion and cadence of the language used. It is as if they transport you safely back in time and give you a glimpse of a world that has fortunately passed but unfortunately has been forgotten. And by that I mean that Americans, of all races, simply do not want to deal with the subject much. Glad to see a TV special that tackles the subject honestly and does not sugarcoat the evils of this nation's history. Bravo to everyone involved.<br /><br />With that out of the way let me also address the clown KompliKated (might as well add the extra ""K"") and his blatantly ignorant comments on this special. He wrote the same junk on the HBO boards and its annoying he is trying to spread his dis-information to every site he can. You can tell how disingenuous he was by stating at first that he had hoped to come away with some insight on the situation (meaning the history of slavery from those who lived it) but was instantly disappointed. Absurd. I guess he was expecting a program that was more pro-slavery with comments from former slaves who had nothing but praise for the lives they led before they were free. Must have been too many viewings of ""Gone With the Wind"" that made him think this. Seriously though would anyone watch a special on the Holocaust and expect the words of survivors to suggest that their experiences in death camps to have been a treat and that the Nazis weren't all that bad? Of course not.<br /><br />KompliKated wrote that the special was only filmed to provoke anger and served no purpose other than to create resentment, blah, blah, blah. No, sir. The purpose was to educate and to give voice to those that suffered from such a sick institution such as slavery. It was a memorial to a chapter in this country's history. People SHOULD be angry over what happened but I don't recall the program suggesting that any black person should go attack any white person because of what occurred back in that time. He called it a racist propaganda that pours salts on open wounds. Laughable. It is racist to recite the words of former slaves in which all they did was relay their own experiences? The documentation of their suffering is propaganda? What ugly hyperbole. The problem with a lot of Americans (specifically white ones) is that they are all about remembering events in America's favor. They will never grow tired of reading and hearing about how American soldiers fought so bravely during WW2 and how the US saved France from Germany. They don't tire of bringing up (in movies, novels, history texts) how the British Empire was unfair to the American colonies which led to the American Revolution. They don't tire of the frequent mention of all the American heroes, all of the American good deeds, all of the positive moments in American history. But when someone has the audacity to point out the flaws and the bad that occurred in America, by the hands of American leaders and citizens, and all of a sudden they can't handle it. They ignore it if at all possible and ask why are the people who are bringing it up still living in the past. Hypocrites. That is why a special like this goes virtually ignored. It reminds people of America's ugly past and slaps them with cold, hard truths. Truths that go against their image of the USA and what it has stood for. That is why Americans don't have any problems not ""moving on"" when it comes to depicting the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. But when it comes to depicting a non-romanticized view of American slavery this country closes its eyes, cuffs its ears and hums really loudly to ignore the facts. That's a mark of insecurity.<br /><br />People like KompliKated are stuck in their ways and can't be reached and frankly its pointless to even bother trying. But for those of you out there who are truly objective and are capable of sitting back and learning something then I would advise you watch this presentation. Its not about whether this program is trying to generate guilt or anger or sadness. Its purpose is simply to foster more understanding on slavery's effect on a people. And it does that splendidly I might add."
24716_0,"Well I think it's actually a pretty good show. Original concept, and I like the characters.<br /><br />One thing I do think though is that it dragged on too long, a lot of things did. InuYasha should have forgotten Kikyo early on into the series, Kikyo should have died early on and stayed dead, and there were too many filler episodes with the same battle sequences. Some of the characters just get tiresome as well.<br /><br />The whole Kikyo thing.. Blablabla, give me a break. I actually prefer Kikyo over Kagome but for one, she's way too old for InuYasha. He acts like he's 16ish whereas she's about 23. Another thing, well, would they just let her be? It's been fifty years, he has Kagome now. To what purpose she was brought back I have no clue. It might have been to cause some type of confusion in Kagome and InuYasha's romance, but it didn't work. Episode 48, where InuYasha chooses Kikyo, sort of changed my idea of the whole series. I was madly in love with it until then.. when I started to just find it all a bit tiresome.<br /><br />The search for the sacred jewel shards definitely goes on far longer than it should. But I guess they just had no ideas of what to do after? They should have just ended the series, instead of just cutting it off randomly and leaving so many people wondering what eventually happens. There are a lot of filler episodes that make you feel as though you've wasted half an hour. <br /><br />Some of the antics by the characters (eg, Kagome's ""sit"", Miroku's obsession with women, Naraku in general) also dragged on far too long.<br /><br />I agree with the people who say to only watch about half of them, they just get a bit annoying after a while. <br /><br />There are a lot of good things (that I won't name.. I don't feel like typing much more), those are just the bad ones. I appreciate this series very much and it will always hold a place in my heart (it was the first anime I really loved, that's why).<br /><br />I still love the show, and watch it a lot. Those are just what I've noticed in this while..."
24761_0,"For me, this was the most moving film of the decade. Samira Makhmalbaf shows pure bravery and vision in the making. She has an intelligence and gift for speaking to the people, regardless of their nationality or beliefs. I am inspired and touched by her humanity and can only hope that she has touched many people the same way. Her message in this film is strong, simple and pure. The human soul can survive the most unheard of cruelties and repression, yet still have the capability to hope and dream even the biggest dreams. Under the most incredible circumstances, the most unexpected people rise up to be heroes. This young girl who has recently regained her voice, yet is still afraid to use her new found freedom, is our hero. She daydreams of becoming president of war torn Afghanistan, the only vision of power that she can imagine that could truly change her current situation. We catch a glimpse of her spirit while witnessing her hardships. In the end, we are left with hope, hope that when her young voice does eventually speak out, it speaks loud and clear for all to hear- sounding a message that transcends borders, nationality and religion. The true epitome of the phoenix rising from the ashes. Hats off to the simple tale of the complex truth."
24806_0,"Myterious Skin is a movie that is perfect in that it captures you in its storytelling and in the end drops its message on you in a very subtle way. Honestly if you don't have a tear in your eye in this powerful ending with its unbelievably intense music by Sigur Ros you must be dead inside. The movie revolts of the growing up of two kids, Neil and Brian, whom we follow from their childhood to their 19th years. Both play in the same baseball team as kids but don't meet again until the end of the film. Neil gets into sexual play with his baseball trainer and turns a gay hustler while Brian sees UFOs and tries to find out about the moments his mind blacked out.. of course thinking of an alien abduction. The movie basically deals with Brian trying to unfold the mystery of his blanked out memory and meeting a strange UFO-Girl with similar experiences while Neil is growing up into more and more sexual obsessed gay life.<br /><br />The way the story is told is just interesting, the acting is incredibly believable from all involved but most of all by Joseph-Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet as the grown up Neil and Brian. The movie has a strange calmness with some beautiful scenes ... except for one particular scene (and having seen Irreversible this is tame) I don't understand what people find shocking about Mysterious skin. The whole way of Neil growing up doesn't seem dramatic... its just the small things hidden behind his acting (like his best friend says he has a black hole where others have a heart) and his distant stare when being hugged. His realization falls close to that of Brian and the way they deal with their past seems so real one can relate to it.<br /><br />I never found myself being so touched by the subject of child abuse especially because of the calmness and the final lines Neil delivers with Brian on his lap and fading into the beautiful piano melody of Sigur Ros' Samskeyti. Mysterious Skin doesn't hammer its message into the viewers head but rather makes him think about the fact that a small moment in the early years can change a life forever and nothing can be undone again. This is a wonderful movie that leads straight into a finale with falling curtains and standing ovations ... finally after so many movies who let you down in the end. All thumbs up!"
24851_0,"An excellent movie my today's standards. There are no ""F"" words, no visual sex, & the only nudity is a brief shot of the top portion of a woman's breasts (no nipples shown) before the camera cuts away to another scene. I would recommend this to any parent wanting a movie that they can show in a mixed audience of teens/pre-teens. If it were made today, it would probably receive a PG rating.<br /><br />Robby Benson & Glynnis O'Connor play their parts well. The movie manages to capture the haunting atmosphere of the song by Bobbie Gentry. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 in 1976 and I still love to watch it."
24897_0,"This film is not a bad movie, but for some reason on here its being attacked. I watched this as a child and thought it was brilliant and watched it when ever it was on. It's got villains, treasure hunt and what shocked some good drama. If you want to make your kids happy pop them down in front of this movie and I guarantee they will enjoy it. Great family film. This film is not the Goonies but the film is based on a similar thing. A 300 year old map, pirates a treasure map and a competition on who can find the treasure first. This film is not yet out on VHS or DVD so if you get a chance to watch in on TV then I recommend you tape it to watch at a later date. Great family fun to have in you're collection, but like I said its no Goonies but it's a good film in its own right."
24941_0,"To think of all the wonderful reviews I've read of this film! The camera work, the real time walk, the fresh acting, the plot twist and noone would disclose anything, and oh the witty dialogue!<br /><br />The first thing I didn't like right away was that the opening dialogue between the unseen couple in the car discloses the whole plot twist. It's totally clear that they are about to be married to each other and that there's a bet on and she even says, 'Time it' so there was no surprise in the rest of the film for me and the friends I watched it with and we spent the rest of the film being sorry for the poor boys taken in by the girl.<br /><br />The second disappointing thing was the witty dialogue. I don't think I ever heard such meaningless pseudo-intellectual blabber in all my life. As for the acting... Well, we've seen way better than that. The girl's fiance is pretty good and some of the people in the smaller street episodes are very very good. But the lead three are plain terrible. Though, I have to say they didn't have much chance to do anything worthy considering the script.<br /><br />The third thing that I thought very amateurish and ridiculous was the so called real time walk along St. Petersburg streets. And what's more, THE St. Petersburg street, Nevsky Prospekt. Now then, one can't really portray St. Petersburg as an 'unnamed Russian city', can one? Especially by showing its main sights and most famous spots like they do in this film. The couple passed the public library at least four times, the Anichkov Palace at least three, the Hermitage (of all places) twice and bought train tickets to Moscow somewhere at a reconstruction site behind the House of Books instead of in a railway ticket centre across the street where they are really sold. That's just bad work, I say, not taking enough time to think that the viewer might actually recognize the place. Probably admitting that the film would never ever be shown in St. Petersburg itself. And it's really really funny to watch, of course.<br /><br />And, I didn't like the storyline at all. But that's a minor thing.<br /><br />There was one thing I did like, though, the episodes with people in historical costumes and the guards on the St. Isaac's observation deck. They were at least funny."
24987_0,"A lot of people have forgotten how to have a good time over the years. This movie brings it all back with its witty humour and an original plot.<br /><br />Before Mike Myers began completely embarrassing himself with the third instalment of Austin Powers, he played many a great character. This movie is not to be missed. A 9/10 in my books."
25030_0,"I'm a big fan of giallo movies, and lately I have become a fan of director Bava, but this film is simply mediocre. This Bava slasher is best remembered for influencing other movies in the subgenre (the ""Friday the 13th"" movies in particular), but the truth is that it is almost unwatchable. I've been very pleased with all the films made by Bava that I've seen, but this one has to be his worst movie. It is a tepid, overcomplicated and downright silly horror film. Imaginative murder sequences aside, it is a real mess. It is confusing for no apparent reason. I'm not sure what Bava was trying to do here, but it is a real letdown from a filmmaker that should know better. The ridiculous ending is so bizarre that I wondered if Bava was responsible for it. It is just an awful movie, so you've been warned. The uncut version of the film is titled ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"", but I do not think a few minutes of extra gore can improve such a sloppy made movie."

She has her sights on Mrs. Waters Mr. Kennedy.<br /><br />Mrs. Radner (Maria Kay) is peeved at boyfriend (Herschel Savage) for driving fast. She ""recovers"" and comes unto him. She assures him that her son Mark isn't home. Mark hides and watch as they go at it by the fountain. Scene is too short. Richard Mailer and his people should have extended it, or exclude the sex scene between older people like Helga Sven and Don Hodge. <br /><br />Lannie, Jeff, Debbie and Kevin meets. Taking the hint from Kevin, Jeff takes Lannie in the kitchen. Debbie teases Kevin before sex. Lannie's dress get wet and she teases Jeff after getting naked. He gets too excited and finishes before starting. Lannie later pleasures herself to Jeff. The scene cuts back and fort between Lannie and a DREAMT encounter with Jeff (Tom Byron) outside on a picnic table. <br /><br />It's like being teased without teasing. Some anticlimactic artistry by director Richard Mailer: The debut sex scene of the highly sought after Kirstie Elizabeth ""Traci Lords"" Knussman is during a dream sequence. Viewers get a sample of her distinctive ""sexual terrorist"" moans. Traci Lords would later write that her first filmed scene was spontaneously done in a kitchen with Tom Byron. Byron has a ""sweet, dopey, puppy-dog thing"" which apparently tingled her. The production crew proceeded to seize the moment as they were in the act. In any event, THAT encounter isn't in this movie. Lords wrote of a poolside three way BEFORE production of What Gets Me Hot! Herself, another female and male. Regard for her allegedly rose when news of said escapade made the industry rounds. She didn't get paid for it. <br /><br />Other than their numerous on-screen copulation, there's been no mention by Lords of a personal relationship with Tom Byron. <br /><br />Mark talks to Kevin, then seduces Kevin's girlfriend Debbie at his house. He becomes her master. Making her get naked for some secret tongue pleasure from Wendy(Leslie Thane). Louis (David Sanders) joins in. Wendy tongues Debbie until Mark tells her to open her eyesshocking her. A foursome happened. <br /><br />Debbie tells Lannie Kevin is a boy. She wants a man like Mark. Lannie has other plans after finding out what gets her hot. She looks over at Cheryl (Susan Hart). (Some poetic money shot of sorts). We now know Traci Lords was, how they say, ""gay for the stay"" in porn. It could be the effects of the drugs."
25120_0,"""Grand Hotel"" is the kind of film that doesn't lose anything during repeated viewings. It is a marvelous MGM production that pretty much embodies the kind of thing the studio did best, during the company's most prolific era. The narrative revolves around one of Germany's most luxurious hotels, the Grand Hotel, which provides the setting for a series of interesting guests that struggle with different problems. The story is really an excuse to display glamorous stars and MGM's now famous ultra glossy production values, but who's complaining? Certainly not me. The film has an all-star cast, and it is a special treat (and lots of fun) to be able to watch each actor compete for the camera's attention. It was a smash hit when it was first released, and the film even managed to win the Oscar for Best Picture. More than seven decades later, the film has somehow retained its initial energy, thanks to the movie's fascinating cast. Watching it again, after so many years, was an enjoyable experience. I was delighted to find out that the film is still a grand piece of soapdish entertainment, and if you have yet to delved into Hollywood's early classic period of film-making, this MGM production provides a nice starting point."
25166_0,"I just wish it was longer, an hour long short would do. If that makes any sense at all. The plot drew me in like a magnetron pull. The best part though is your wonder and amazement through the adventure. Bravo I do say so myself for a well organized structure of a story. I just can't believe this isn't a big hit. I mean yes it does have some dry humor in it. That is because it fits like a skeleton key in these generic movies with extraordinary plots. I do feel a little ""deja vu"" in a sense. It feels like this was a in a show or was a short clip of a movie. Or maybe just a hybrid of random plots that already steam-lined through my mind. Don't take my word for it, see it. And see it anywhere you can(I just watched it on this site). Just imagine if this movie was a little stretched out. Instead of punching you in the face with an explosion of climatic cinema type. Maybe that is just me, but sometimes it feels like you need to beat around the bush to get to the bass of a situation. Still a great plot, climax, and hero."
25210_0,"Douglas Fairbanks Snr., can quite fairly be given credit for the first movie action star. 'The Black Pirate' has a number of sequences which highlight his magnificent athletic ability. I found myself marveling at the extended sequence where he seizes a merchant ship singlehandedly. What strength and skill, what agility and courage! I loved watching him scale the stern of the ship and was extremely impressed by his cutting open of the sails from top to bottom with a knife. Some of the work was quite funny and you could tell that the filmed footage was being shown in reverse but that doesn't stop the stunts themselves from being extremely entertaining. He's got more guts than me, I'll say that much!<br /><br />'The Black Pirate' is difficult to evaluate. Do we grade a film based upon:<br /><br />a) other pirate films b) silent films c) on a general level of enjoyment against all films<br /><br />As a silent film, and for that matter a two strip Technicolor silent film, 'The Black Pirate' is a landmark for innovation. Fairbanks had misgivings about the use of colour but felt a pirate film MUST be shown in colour. He gets great benefit. There is a great deal of implied violence (duh, a pirate film!) and the bright red colour of blood is almost shocking to see. There's a scene where a captive tries to hide a ring he's wearing by swallowing it. Unfortunately for him he's seen. After a little off camera ... searching... for the ring, a pirate presents a bloodied ring in bloodied hands as he wipes a bloodied dagger on his tunic to the captain. Pretty thrilling stuff for the 1920's. This was also a film where very serious philosophy and training were put to great effect with the fencing. You can see how it out-steps a lot of earlier swordplay films and influenced the style in films that would follow. According to film historian Rudy Behlmer on an excellent commentary track with the Kino DVD, the fencing master hired by Fairbanks became a staple of the industry. Many of the great sword fight movies from the next 25 years were his handiwork -- including 'The Adventures of Robin Hood,' and 'Captain Blood.'<br /><br />Against other pirate films, 'The Black Pirate' has perhaps more value as a curiosity. Even by the late 1930's and 40's it was being outdistanced by Errol Flynn films like 'Captain Blood' and 'The Seahawk,' Tyrone Power in 'The Black Swan,' or Burt Lancaster in 'The Crimson Pirate.' Today it gets totally wiped off the board by the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series. Though still fun to watch, these later films are better and more enjoyable. <br /><br />This is definitely worth tracking down on the Kino DVD if you can find it. Rudy Behlmer has an excellent commentary track that is of great value to people who are interested in early Hollywood and Douglas Fairbanks. I recommend it highly for the student or the general enthusiast based upon that reason. And it is a good movie to! 'The Black Pirate' has a great sense of adventure to it with thrilling stunt work. Silent movie fans shouldn't be disappointed. Fans of pirate movies should give it a try to see what helped popularize the genre."

25300_0,"I was a little bit afraid, I can't really take yet another sugar-filled love story on the airplane, but this movie was really different. What I liked best was that unhollywoodish feeling when the movie don't try to tell me ""they love one another very much"" for 10 heavy minutes, or ""it's really sweet that they meet again"" for another 10 minutes, they just flash 10-20 seconds of nicely shot moments which is just enough for a moviegoer with above minimal intelligence to get the point. I don't like things over-explained.<br /><br />I liked the acting as well, I almost smell the lack of comfort when Felix meet the girl from time to time, and lots of closeups made me always feel that these persons are in fact real, and not acting on an average story thread. There were funny moments (flushing the phone made everyone 'AWWW!') but overall the film was rather serious.<br /><br />It was very interesting to see the ""low-budgetness"" of the movie: there wasn't really anything more than acting, dialogs; if that's good, it makes a really good movie.

First off is that the acting is not very good. The actors seem to put enough effort and energy into their parts, but it just doesn't come across in the end. I suppose this is to be expected in this type of movie, but they seemed more interested in wild exaggeration than in good acting. Second is that the humour just isn't that funny. There are a few good laughs, but it's very inconsistent. There's no attempt at all at realism. The scene in which the dog, trying to fight off the kidnappers, gets hold of Willard's hand and shreds it, spraying blood all over the room is just plain stupid. It looks like a long wig attached to Norm MacDonald's (Willard's) arm. And, given the amount of blood that appeared in the scene, it's hard to explain why there isn't even a mark on Willard's hand the next time we see him! A miracle cure for dog bites? I mean, I don't expect perfection from this kind of movie, but it would be nice if there were at least some effort put into continuity. How much would it have cost to put a bandage on Willard's hand?<br /><br />Most of the performances are sub-par. MacDonald seemed quite artificial most of the way through. Sherman Hemsley as Chip was a disaster. Elaine Stritch was certainly crotchety, but also not especially funny as Miss Crock. There was a decent performance from Daniel Benzali as Detective Dewey, who did exactly what this kind of movie demanded: he played it absolutely straight, and was quite funny as a result. The best performance was undoubtedly David Chappelle as Rusty Hayes, Willard's partner in crime. The biggest disappointment in my opinion was Danny DeVito. I usually enjoy him, and think he is a fine comedic actor, but his performance in Screwed was not good. He seemed too forced and didn't look as though he were enjoying himself playing Grover Cleaver.<br /><br />Hey, take it for what it's worth. It's not great, but it has a few laughs in it, and a totally crazy storyline. And, at 1:21, it doesn't take much commitment to see it through.<br /><br />I gave it 4/10."
25616_0,"Before I watched this movie I was actually excited on watching this comedy/documentary movie. However, I was led to a big time let down. I am a Mexican-American and I was thinking it was going to be a movie that jokes about our stereotypes, but it was not like that at all. It was based more on how ""upper-class white"" people heavily depended on the cheap work of illegal immigrants. The movie classified most immigrants of those who are very loyal and humble, and at the same time they appeared to be very weak with no character and their main purpose was to serve white people. Point is illegal immigrants are people and they do have feeling and are not just personal slaves. They do get mad and have other feelings. They also talk mess about their boss, like most people do, behind their backs. I felt that this movie did not give this illegal immigrants that chance to show that they are also people.<br /><br />Even though there is still a lot of racism out there, they showed most white people as racists whom are helpless without an illegal immigrant doing cheap labor. I am not white and it might be true, but white people are people, they can easily adapt to changes in their environment. There are some white people that do cheap labor not all white people are rich.<br /><br />One last thing that i strongly disagree with this movie is that what if there are not Mexicans around there is still a whole bunch of Central-Americans and South-Americans who are always classified as Mexicans. If you eliminate the illegal immigrant Mexican you still will have a lot of illegal immigrants of different places of this planet that will do that cheap labor work. Is not just the Mexican who is the cheap labor illegal immigrant in this nation. Finally, disregarding the rest, the movie was not funny, and I didn't even seem to get a chuckle at that. If you want to see a way better comedy movie about illegal immigrants I recommend you to watch Born in East L.A."
25661_0,"Coneheads is one of the best ""Saturday Night Live"" movies. I was expecting a light comedy but what I got was a whole lot more. Following a similar plot to the skit, Coneheads is the story about the Beldar Conehead family who crash on earth during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good. <br /><br />This is where the movie shows its heart. It could have been a movie of comedy bits but by the end, it is about happiness in a stable family, which is quite refreshing in these days of depressing movies about divorces and unmarried couples. It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the ""Let Your Kids Be Who They Are"" mentality of these days. The direction of the film in excellent, setting up many nice visual gags and shots that are very impressive for a comedy film. And at times, the film feels ""epic"" as you see the family on the run from the INS, to moving to the suburbs to returning to their planet. <br /><br />There are great performances throughout the film and the many cameos are perfect. Look for funny scenes from Jan Hooks, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Garrett Morris. Michelle Burke makes a nice debut as Connie Conehead and I expect to see more of her in the future. <br /><br />On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised."
25706_0,"You don't have to agree with its message to enjoy the first ""Walking Tall"". Certainly not as violent as the ""Dirty Harry"" pictures, but just as unsubtle, it was a powerful movie with a totally convincing, appropriately square performance by Joe Don Baker. <br /><br />The first sequel, in which Baker was replaced by Bo Svenson, was a boring, by-the-numbers follow-up, with none of the force of the original.<br /><br />The second sequel is even worse; talky and drab, it exploits (in an almost cannibalistic way) the first movie by lifting and recreating the most famous sequences from it. There are a few good moments (when Pusser picks up his trusty bat), but they are very scarce."
25751_0,"I had only recently become aware of this DVD as it was being advertised as containing missing footage from Game of Death. What an understatement watching this footage is just an incredible experience. That coupled with the documentary portion of this DVD truely gives us a better insight IMO into what Bruce was about, and the way he was trying to show us all."
25797_0,"I was intrigued by the storyline, as I was surfing the cable channel late one night; an apocalyptic tale of two lovers trying to escape to Antarctica to avoid a nuclear holocaust! What entailed, however, was one bumbling misstep after another by two young lovers who were not exactly the sharpest tacks in the box. How I made it through from beginning to end in itself was a Miracle! Don't waster your time on this horrible flick unless you are being paid large sums of money to watch it!"
25841_0,"This is one of the best pieces of creative work. What makes this movie even more powerful is the fact that it is based on truth. It makes one realize how lucky one is to be born free and live & breath in environment where there are no shackles. It instills in you the love for free world where one is born and where life runs and smiles and where humanity prevails over the anguish & pain of inhuman torturous places like Devils Island. We must learn to love our freedom while we still have it. The movie portrays the horrors of solitary excellently and of all the worst things that a human may do to the other, i think solitary lies at the lowest level of humanity. You can feel it through, the unbearable distress of solitary confinement and how it cripples all you ability to think and believe. I think Mcqueen was excellent there. I recommend this for all those who have the desire to understand the urge of running from a hell like devils island and back into the world, our world!"
25887_0,"I am a fan of the Real World and thought the idea of a Lost Season movie sounded pretty cool. Knowing that it was all an acted out production unlike the Real World was ok with me. The idea seemed original and interesting with a season gone very wrong and the tapes and footage being covered up. My first disappointment came with the marketing strategy used in the promotion. They seemed to try to go with the Blair Witch approach by saying there was a lost season of film not used due to a disaster of some sort. That was sort of cool and gave it an almost scary and suspenseful feel. Then the later advertising became annoying by using goofy reporters and very unreal Real World executives. These terrible ads made me not want to tune in to this 2-hour commercial free presentation. Still I gave it a chance having been pleased by previous M TV productions in the past. To my disappointment the movie was just as bad as the commercials. The appearance of some of the original Real World casts was a plus, and then the actors came in to play and ruined it all. The story was poorly written with no imagination and only cashing in on the cheap thrills that M TV uses so often such as sex, sexuality, and sex. M TV also tried to rip off on The Blair Witch Project once more with its jerky camera work. The acting was terrible which is weird since the magic of the Real World is the fact there is no acting. This idea had so much promise but just fell in the wrong hands to carry it out. I recommend not watching the re-airing of this movie and knowing M TV there will be plenty of re-airings in the future. After seeing this movie I think maybe M TV should hang up the filming hat and go back to the basics, namely music and leave films to some one else. In the end this Real World movie was a Real Loser."
25931_0,"This movie reminded me quite a lot about a book I own and read occasionally. The book was about a homecoming and pageant queen who was pretty, popular, and seemed to live the perfect life. That is until she got fat. In contrast, Kaley Cuoco portrays a pretty thin girl who documents life as a fat person by altering her appearance by wearing a fat suit, and not changing her true self. Life as an overweight individual opened up the true souls of her so called friends. They shunned her, harassed her, and treated her like low life scum. No one paid any attention to her personality, and the fat people at her school thought she was a walking joke. Yet, I really think that the film really makes us realize that who shouldn't judge one by looks, but the sad fact about that is true. We seem to make rude comments about to those who are physically different just because people have low self esteem and zero confidence that they take it on those who appear weaker then they. I'm more on the slender side with blond hair and bluish green eyes. However, I'm physically different that I will not post, but I had my share of experiences with the cruel comments, jokes, and harassment. However, I paid no attention to that because I lived my own life, and true people accepted for who I was, and not my appearance. We cannot help what we look like, unless you want to live a healthy lifestyle, you can make a few changes with diet and exercise. Physical deformities we can't really change, unless you go under dangerous surgeries. I think that 99% of women have image issues and they're unhappy with themselves because they think they can't do better. They fall into depression which can lead to dangerous eating disorders and cosmetic surgeries simply because of what society portrays. I believe that everyone has a ""best"" about them, whether it's talent, looks, or personality, and the key is to be yourself, and not what others want you to be. You'll be a total lie to yourself."
25977_0,"When husband and wife decide to split, the only ones who get hurt are the children, and even though Joan and Bernard Berkman are in the center of their nasty divorce, their two sons -- Frank and Walt -- are the ones going through the trauma. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed this insightful, biting story of a family deadlocked in its inner battles based on his own life experiences and the result is bittersweet.<br /><br />Bernard claims to have been an influential author of novels who has fallen on hard times. Frank idolizes him and has the same clipped, insolent tones as if he were talking to an admiring audience. Bernard openly attacks his wife Joan as if it were a requisite for their marriage to exist and Frank decides he too can't stand her. On the other hand, Joan, once Bernard casually reveals her affair with a neighbor, is coming into her own as a writer and as selfish as she may seem at times, she's the better person in the marriage. Walt, the youngest son, tilts towards her but is going through his own inner changes and is expressing it through masturbation -- especially on library books and his mother's lingerie.<br /><br />After the Berkman's separate, Bernard and the boys move into the new house -- a rickety place within the vicinity -- and Joan initiates her life with Ivan, Walt's tennis tutor. A quadrangle and a triangle of sorts develops when Bernard rents a room to one of his female students, Lili, and begins a tentative affair with her. Frank, who is going out with a girl he seems embarrassed to be seen with, also pines and almost succeeds in seducing Lili. His father even encourages it. Events involving Bernard's and Joan's war eventually lead to a nasty head which will make Frank take a decision about himself.<br /><br />What makes THE SQUID AND THE WHALE such a great little film is how natural it seems at all turns and how slice of life it is. I kept getting references from French New Wave all over the place. Baumbach writes his characters like real people at all times. Bernard's relationship with his sons is real. Look at when he and Walt curse over losing a table tennis match in almost exact verbal intonations, or when both he and Frank lock themselves in their elitist world and chatter about Kafka, how Bernard has decided he was once a brilliant writer which may or not be true, and how ""A Tale of Two Cities"" was a lesser Dickens as if reading it meant getting an eye infection. Frank, in imitating his father's worst traits, when it is discovered that a song he'd written was in fact a song by Pink Floyd and in a Ted Bundy style argues that ""it was as if he had written it so it was his by appropriation"" exposes him for the empty snob he is on the inside. Joan, while a little unsympathetic here and there, is a real human and one who maintains her composure when its clear her writing career is on the rise even if her family is about to implode. When she propitiates the demise of her family it's at first seen as an act of selfish abandonment, but one look at Bernard and his abrasive, self-obsessed, hurtful personality and all is explained. Now, Walt has a more internal character development despite some verbal outbursts at the beginning of the movie. Once the family is divided and he is left increasingly alone, his psyche begins delving into his own sexual awakening which under the detached music of Tangerine Dream is seen as something he himself doesn't understand. It's clear he's more tolerant of the two brothers and able to accept Ivan -- an much better guy as his mother's new guy.<br /><br />There's also an interesting subtext involving the film BLUE VELVET that may or nor may be intentional. While Frank invites his father to see SHORT CIRCUIT, his father arrogantly puts that film down (for being commercial) and decides they will see BLUE VELVET. The climactic scene where the main characters converge at the Williams' household seems to open a door to Frank's sexual fascination with brunettes and fuses his progressive revulsion of Sophie, a dead ringer for Laura Dern. The appearance of the dark-haired Lili increases this -- she holds within a similar mystique that lures Frank and leads him to push Sophie away in a painful scene.<br /><br />THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is a sharp domestic drama about bitter people caught within their own patterns of behavior and it lingers on after its abrupt but symbolic ending. Even with Walt's forays into bizarre behavior, which is not as disturbing as a part of a boy's growth, it's Frank -- Noah Baumbach's apparent alter-ego -- who has the moment of clarity to see things as they really are and not be a figment of his father's poison. The moment he realizes he has been a pawn in a needless war between Bernard and Bernard -- not Bernard and Joan as initially depicted, he does what anyone would have done: run and let his feet and instinct take him to the truth.<br /><br />And as is the case with these kinds of movies, all of the performances are on-target. Laura Linney continues on her winning streak of textured, modern women. Jeff Daniels made me feel like I was in the presence of a real jerk who could have a moment of sympathy but chose to remain locked in his delusions, and that takes guts. Ditto of Jesse Eisenberg who at times reminded me of Ted Bundy. Anna Paquin and William Baldwin fill out believable people with their minimal scenes and Owen Kline made me think of an adult trapped in a kid's body. Overall, this is a near-perfect film from start to finish."
26020_0,"An alright sequel that really stands on its own. This sequel makes little a note to the first one, remember the one with Kevin Bacon. But other then that this movie stands on its own. This movie begins with a crazed invisible man named Michael Griffin(Christian Slater), who is on the war path to get an antidote for him. He will stop at nothing, and kill anyone that gets in his way. His trails lead up to Dr. Maggie Dalton(Laura Reagen), she soon seeks protection with Detective Frank Turner(Peter Facinelli). But a certain government starts to hunt them both, cause they want to cover up what has happened to Griffin. Christian Slater was awesome in his performance has the mad invisible man. Peter Facinelli and Laura Reagen were also good. This movie had a great storyline, and great effects, and not to mention great suspense also."
26066_0,"Very funny. Completely captivating. The visual style was all 70's pastel kitsch: house, clothes, hair. Cheesy low-tech special effects don't seem to follow any particular style but simply add fun comedy touches. Strong language is often fresh and honest. The aging actress character always says exactly what's on her mind. Think of it as ""Hairspray"" meets ""Valley of the Dolls""."
26110_0,"This movie was based on the murders of the three civil rights workers in 1964. Attack On Teror really gave a better view in story line, than Mississippi Burning. These three workers were jailed by the Deputy Sheriff on a speeding ticket. After they were released, they were on their way South out of town. Later they were followed by the Deputy Sheriff along with Ku Klux Klan members. On a country road they were pulled over shot and killed. The blue station wagon was burn't. The three were found buried in a Dam yard. This was world attention, in the news. It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew. Personally I hate the Confederate Flag. It's a symbol of hate, white supremacy and of course the KU Klux Klan. I like only the American Flag and the Christain Flag. There was no excuse for the murder of these three men. They came to investigate a church fire. No matter whether it's a white church or a black church, burning down the Lord's house is wrong. I likewise didn't like Gene Hackman's brutal tactics in this movie. Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water. That's not how law enforcement officers should act. I would encourage you all to get the real facts and watch Attack On Terror. You will get a better story, than this low budget movie."
26156_0,"Bollywood crowds were not pleased with this film. For good reason of course. This movie breaks out of the regular tradition of song, dance and predictable drama and creates a movie rarely seen in the Bollywood industry. The direction was amazing. The movie was inspired by many action movies from the past but what makes it different is its setting and culture. Very few Hindi movies have been made with such openness and innovation. If you want a new twist on a classic story watch Karam. It will blends elements of Bollywood and American action. Its an entertaining watch if nothing else. Some scenes are a little graphic but they are not gratuitous. Also, the casting was excellent."
26200_0,"I select films that I do not think I have seen before. I have no idea who made them who is in them or what they are about. I just use them to fill an hour or so. Many I never watch to the end. I thought this was just another made in Hollywood movie. Instead it was the movie equivalent of the book I was unable to put down. No one, not the director, the actors or the crew imposed their message on me ( I saw the Irish pub theatre version of Alexander last week, that movie tattoos it's message on your eyeballs). This movie was peopled by personalities, pictures and places. It was a piece of Anglo French (or the other way round)excellence. My personal thanks to all those who made the movie for making me feel I had not wasted at least this time in my life. Smashing!!!!!!"
26246_0,"This movie sucked. The box claimed that it was the female version of Die-Hard, this movie was anything but that. It started out as soft port then a horror flick and finally an action sequence. The only redeeming quality was that it was only 80 mins. I was really disappointed since I thought this movie was similar to Die Hard but I guess not. Grrrrrrrrrr."
26291_0,"First half had me laughing out of my seat. Being a Canadian-born confused desi I could relate to all of the humour. The second half of the film was a bit of a letdown as the writer tried to resolve the issues in a quick fashion. I would liken this movie to ""Soul Man"" where there was great potential but only a ""good"" movie as a result. Thoroughly enjoyable but could have been a classic!"

26381_0,"This movie left me amazed. In my opinion it is one of the best films of all time. Some reviewers here have criticized the film for being historically inaccurate. To those reviewers I say, if you don't like the film, why don't you watch another film about the 15th century Mayans................. Oh wait, I remember. There aren't any. You'll find many films about England, and France, and Austria. And some other Eurocentric Epic, but hardly anything about any other Civilization in the world, and for them to knock a Director that actually had a little vision, to make a movie about another part of the world is disappointing. Its easy to get on the Mel Gibson hate bandwagon.<br /><br />But, back to the film.<br /><br />Visually stunning. I felt like I was part of the adventure, incredibly stunning camera work. The acting? The actors weren't acting as Mayans, they became Mayans. Every single performance was convincing.<br /><br />The Violence? First of All, I couldn't finish watching Sin City simply because it glorified senseless violence and I hate senseless violence, and yet its on the top 100 list-go figure. This is not the case with Apocalypto, the movie is about people that were abducted to be SACRIFICED, gee, I guess there won't be blood, or violence. I happen to think it was used appropriately.<br /><br />//SPOILERS Purpose of Film? Someone said this film is meaningless. This is not accurate. Opening quote: ""Before a civilization is destroyed without, its destroyed within"". The Film is about a Society that has become Depraved. A society that had become so corrupt, and insensitive, human life become worthless. Historically inaccurate? I think not, Aztecs, Canaanites, Carthagians,etc, etc. Again, something Never explored in films.<br /><br />Finally, Hope. Never giving up.End of Old era, New Beginnings.<br /><br />All in All, this Film is groundbreaking. People are always complaining about Hollywood being predictable. When a movie breaking new ground appears, its booed off the stage.<br /><br />;-)"
26426_0,"Vaguely at the center of THE DYING GAUL is a screenplay for a potential movie. The plot of the would-be movie, also called ""The Dying Gaul,"" concerns a gay couple and what happens when one of them is faced with AIDS. It would make a perfect movie, so says the studio exec who wants to buy it and film it, except that the couple really doesn't have to be gay. And it doesn't really have to be called ""The Dying Gaul."" And I guess it doesn't really have to be about AIDS. And, when you get right down to it, the plot of this film itself doesn't really have to be about Hollywood, screen writing, homosexuality, AIDS, infidelity or betrayal. But it has to be about something for it to be worth our time. And it isn't.<br /><br />Strip away the pretentiousness of the supposed noble symbolism of ""the Dying Gaul,"" brush aside the trendiness of it being set in Hollywood, and forget the faux importance of it exploiting AIDS; and THE DYING GAUL is nothing but a gimmicky soap opera with a contrived and not-particularly-honest twist. It's a love triangle wherein the anonymity of an internet chat room not only becomes a vehicle for deceit but the basis for a seemingly supernatural scam. Lovers and/or rivals building a wicked web of lies out of disguises is as old as drama, be the pretense coming in the form of masked balls, con games, mistaken identities, innocent pen pal letters or CB radios. Playing such duplicity for laughs, this sort of romantic misdirection can work nicely, but THE DYING GAUL has less in common with YOU'VE GOT MAIL than with the gloomy, pseudo-realism of overwrought junk like CLOSER.<br /><br />The neophyte screenwriter is Robert (Peter Sarsgaard), who wrote the script to honor his deceased partner, Malcolm. Jeffrey (Campbell Scott) is the producer who wants to make the movie, but insists that the sexuality of the protagonists is irrelevant; straight or gay, it is all the same, pain and loss is universal -- but straight pain and loss is more commercial. He should know, Jeff is bisexual and seems more interested in Robert's sword than his pen. But Jeff loves his wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), who becomes fast friends with Robert, until she figures out that the two guys are collaborating in more ways than one. So far, so good. Then writer/director Craig Lucas derails his entire project by letting his entire film become hijacked by a lame and contrived gimmick. Elaine, using a fake identity, begins exchanging messages with Robert via the internet and convinces the already disturbed writer that he is actually communicating with the spirit of his dead lover. Apparently DSL reaches as far as Heaven's gate.<br /><br />Even as the film prattles on about mythic themes and makes references to famed art and literature, yet sells out to a lame technological gimmick, it still has potential. Elaine suddenly has the power to control Robert and, indirectly, her husband. But Elaine doesn't know what to do with her newfound power, and unfortunately neither does Lucas. The confused story takes a dark turn and it is obviously headed for tragedy, but Lucas balks at making the film either an outright thriller or even a psychologically twisted comedy. He has a cast of morally bankrupt characters (well acted by excellent actors), but he seems unwilling to let any of them be the villain. Each are painted as being capable of killing, but when death finally takes a role in the story it is left frustrating unclear whether a murder was even committed. The ambiguity is meant to be clever or disturbing or shocking, but it is really just a sign of incredibly bad writing.<br /><br />The film certainly doesn't play to our expectations. Lucas is an acclaimed gay playwright and is probably best known for his script for LONGTIME COMPANION, a landmark in gay cinema. So when the film at first appears to be about the integrity of gay fiction -- compromising orientation and honesty to pander to a straight public -- there is a promise of THE DYING GAUL being a story of substance. But that quickly evaporates when the ineffectual Robert far too easily sells out his values -- literary and sexual -- to the charming and pragmatic bisexual Jeffrey. Then there is the hope that the film will be about redemption, about Robert regaining his self-respect and ethics -- but that never materializes and if anything the characters grow increasingly amoral -- and increasingly less interesting.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story seems intent on proving Jeffrey right, that the sexuality of the protagonists is irrelevant; straight or gay, it is all the same, good and evil are hardly relevant. And, I suppose, there is some minor victory to be had by Lucas showing no need to be politically correct by making Robert neither a role model nor a tragic hero -- but just another unredeemable human wretch. But the victory is very small and no more meaningful or gratifying than Robert's ultimate reward.<br /><br />And for what is worth, Jeffrey is right; THE DYING GAUL is a lousy title."

26561_0,"This movie is great fun to watch, like you would expect from a genre movie such as this one. It has all the typical adventurous, action and comedy elements present to make this a great swashbuckling movie. Add to that Douglas Fairbanks in good shape and you have a classic unforgettable genre movie!<br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks is totally great in this one. He looks, acts, breaths, eats like a real superstar. He handles all of the athletic action in the movie really well. It's not hard to see why this man was THE swashbuckling hero of the '20's.<br /><br />The movie is really great looking, with many grand looking sets. Really great looking stuff! (though obviously all fake.) Something you would normally expect to see in a D.W. Griffith movie. The movie also has some silly looking but yet great early special effects, toward the ending of the movie.<br /><br />The story has all the ingredients needed for such a genre movie as this one; an heroic main character, a love interest, stereotypical villains and lots of fun and action. Especially toward the ending the movie starts to become greatly adventurous after a sort of slower middle and good first part. It's of course all rather simple and formulaic but this is also what makes the genre so great. You just always know what to expect. It's good simple fun that's professionally and well made, that's also beautiful to look at.<br /><br />Also definitely fun to see how much of this movie was later used again in Disney's ""Aladdin"". Some, mostly action sequences, are obviously almost directly copied.<br /><br />A great fun movie, from swashbuckling-specialist director Raoul Walsh.<br /><br />9/10"
26606_0,This is a wonderful story with very interesting characters topped off by some awesome animation. The english dub even has some well done voice acting to boot.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a fan of anime this is required watching.
26651_0,"This picture is most unique, and is really superb in terms of generating interest and capturing the audience's attention. There are excellent performances from great talents like Rosie Perez and Wynona Ryder, and a wonderful early glimpse of Roberto Benigni as the very explicit Italian taxi cabdriver in a scene that is absolutely hilarious. This is a classic small film-it works wonders on the small screen- imagine what it could do as a blockbuster, though it's small screen image gives it an extra boost. In order to catch great films such as these you either have to watch Bravo or attend Film Festivals, which is what makes films such as these rare gems."
26697_0,"For horror fans, this is one of the original slasher/video nasty films, and therefore carries a little respect, and a little consideration for it's failings.<br /><br />My copy is the slightly edited ""Grim Reaper"" as opposed to the original and supposedly un-cut ""Antropophagus"". It is annoyingly dubbed, whereas I would prefer subtitles were it in a foreign language. Strangely I couldn't quite be sure of this... the blind English girl is definitely speaking English.. but as for the others?? Oh well, I digress! Much of the movie is badly lit... the screen is too dark, and although this could be construed as being spooky or mystifying, I think it's rather unnecessary. Likewise the music is confusingly dramatic, seems to appear in all the wrong places. Maybe this is a technique designed to unsettle the senses, but either way, makes viewing difficult at first.<br /><br />Basically, a nutball psycho is loose on an island, and some people visit the island. Slash, stab, chew, gore, mess. Surprise, bluff, suspense, inevitability. What more could a slash/horror fan want?? <br /><br />In two words ""nostalgic value"". I rated a ""4"" for originality."
26741_0,"I just watched this movie on the Sci-fi network. Let's make one thing perfectly clear: there has never, ever been a quality film or television show that has used the phrase `It's on a need-to-know basis'. Once you hear that phrase, and its subsequent follow-up phrase `believe me, I need to know', you can rest assured you're watching something written by someone with absolutely no creativity.<br /><br />Sandra Bernhard is terribly miscast in this five hundredth derivation of `Alien'. Whining and sneering her way through this movie, she sounds ridiculously unconvincing spouting the technical mumbo-jumbo necessary for science fiction films. She aint no Sigourney Weaver, that's for sure. How someone so marvelous in something like `Roseanne' can be such a bad actor in films like this and `Hudson Hawk' is one of the mysteries of life.<br /><br />This film has the production values of a high-school play: cheap-looking sets, bad lighting, and clumsy-looking props. The spacesuits look like second-rate rejects from Joe's Army Surplus. When Sandra comes back into the ship after a spacewalk, she flips the visor lid up, and there's no seal around it! The flimsy visor looks like it was made from a clear plastic pie-cover from Safeway. There are no special effects, unless you call an exterior shot of the spaceship a special effect. They couldn't even spring for some fancy flashing lights or decent music; tapping military-style drumbeats punctuate some of the scenes, while someone practicing a bass fiddle provides the rest of the music.<br /><br />Typical of bad films, during the shootout scenes, many many shots are fired in all directions, but it is only coincidental that anyone gets hit, even at point-blank range. Is it wise to fire a gun onboard a spaceship while you're surrounded by all kinds of machinery that is keeping you alive?<br /><br />Most of the film consists of close-ups of people standing around talking or arguing while sepia-colored walls float in the background. I'm convinced that the dialogue was written by a thirteen-year-old boy after watching video games for eighteen hours straight: `she belongs to me', `it's stuck in a loop!', `you don't drink martinis!', and so forth. You get the idea.<br /><br />As if that isn't bad enough, a videotaped Laura San Giacomo rocks back and forth spouting Shakespeare. Good thing she had `Just Shoot Me' to fall back on.<br /><br />The only way to describe the quality of this film is that this is the kind of movie they show on Saturday afternoons when the football game is pre-empted. The television station figures `what the hell, there's no one watching anyway.' It's either that, or an infomercial."

Chuck Norris? Our country isn't concerned with his facts,by the way he is much more popular in here,and the poster of film actually have him..(although he made it 10 minutes max.) So,if you are some kinda evolved with University Entrance Exam,you definitely enjoy this film,but you are from another country maybe enjoy the feelings of students and-thankful for yours- because there is no empathy for you.."
26831_0,"Peter Jackson has a big heart, I think. Even for all the gore and grossness of his films (i.e.; Dead Alive aka Braindead) he always has a very heartfelt moment of sentiment. In this film, it's the loving way McKenzie is treated and the seriousness of his death scene, captured on film. While much of the film has very tongue in cheek chuckles, this part is played very seriously.<br /><br />Also, as someone who works every day with ""forgotten silver"", I admire his treatment of the whole subject. For, while McKenzie and his films may be bogus, the plight of old movies is not. I'm amazed at how much footage shows up in attics and basements and garden sheds every year. In just the eight months so far of 1999, we have received at least 30 ""new"" films; rare and unique items all. And we have films done by people very much like Colin McKenzie. Private, personal projects, most of which never saw the light of day or vanished quickly after their initial release. So much ""forgotten silver."""
26877_0,"Say what you like about a good independent movie or a good b-movie but to me, a good film like ACNE, beats a decent $80 million dollar film every time. Yes, the acting isn't as professional with this film, but that adds a certain realism. Yes, the sets aren't always picture perfect but whose house or office is? ACNE is a horror movie for 2005 and beyond. The threats to the main characters are as real as what people face everyday around our planet. Pollution, exploitation, manipulation, false promises, disease and disfigurement but it does so with a twisted black comic heart and believe me, you're going to laugh (with the movie)."
26921_0,"In two and a half hours Clint Eastwood paints a thought provoking piece on heroism and war-propaganda. The film tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island. In the style of Saving Private Ryan (Spielberg is a producer of Flags) the viewer gets a astounding look at war with a lot of blood, guts and CGI. Second is the story of a son of one of the flag raisers on that island, who interviews other survivors of that battle to understand his dad a little better. This is very moving stuff, but stands a little pale in comparison to the final storyline. This is where veteran-director Eastwood really shines. Like his meditation on violence Unforgiven, Flags takes a closer look at heroism where soldiers by chance get into the spotlight of the war-propaganda-machine. Some may say that Eastwood made an anti-war film or even an anti-America film, but they're wrong. Flags is very critical on the way war is sold to the public. There's nothing honorable about killing or to be killed on the battlefield. The only thing that matters is that you protect you're friends in your platoon and that they protect you. Flags is one of the best war movies I ever saw, maybe even better than Ryan, because it's never sentimental and always honest in its portrayal of the soldiers and war in general."
26967_0,"Often when a classic movie is forgotten there is a good reason for it. However this is not the case with Eagle & the Hawk. Sure it's no masterpiece but it's a pretty solid WWI movie that focuses on the realities of war. It reminds me somewhat of ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" It's not quite as good as that but it has similar themes. <br /><br />The movie stars Fredric March & Cary Grant. Cary Grant is probably the more well known star today but back in 1933 March was the bigger name and he is the main star with Grant as the supporting player. I love Cary Grant and he does a pretty good job here playing a character that is not completely sympathetic. This is the type of part that you would not really see from him later in his career. However March is the real star of this picture and he is absolutely fantastic as a soldier who slowly loses his nerve. It's a real shame March is not better remembered today. Overall March and Grant have great on screen chemistry and interact well as two WWI pilots who dislike each other yet respect the others' abilities. The ending in my opinion is also quite memorable.<br /><br />The only sour point of the film is a small cameo by Carole Lombard. Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of Lombard but her part is pretty pointless here and it doesn't mesh with the rest of the film. It just seems the writers wanted to add a little romance to the movie whether it fit or not."
27010_0,"'Big Brother' is without a shadow of a doubt the worst programme ever to have tainted our television screens. All it consists of is a group of people living in a large house far from the outside world but under the watchful eye of a C.C.T.V camera. The idea is to avoid periodic evictions from the house, whoever succeeds in this task will win a cash prize. Amongst the 'Brother' contestants, the most famous one was the now deceased Jade Goody (a girl who once thought East Anglia to be abroad!). Having a show like this on her C.V is nothing to be proud of. The show's title is named after the fictional character in George Orwell's novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. I wonder if Orwell (if he were still alive that is) would be happy to find that one of his character's names is used as the title for such an excuse for a show, I think not! At least no one has to suffer this show any longer as the T.V stations have now come to their senses and taken 'Brother' off the air, though why it lasted as long as it did in the first place is beyond me."
27056_0,"Knock Knock is a film that needs a chance. This is what is obviously going to earn hate. This movie seems confusing and according to other views, people don't really understand what is clearly put out there. This slasher focuses on a very dark origin for it's killer. The origin is sad and you feel sorry for him, which is a good thing.<br /><br />The lead of this film is not any kid, okay, it's pretty damn obvious the lead is the Killer or if not the cop. The Kids are just the kills that the killer comes back to do.<br /><br />Now when I watched this movie, I was confused at first and thought about turning it off, but please stick with it, as all the confusion fades and you get a crystal clear picture of why everything happens like it does.<br /><br />If you like movies souly for senseless kills, then I suggest you go find some other (horrible) horror film then. This is a film you have to think to understand, and a movie that doesn't make you think isn't worth anything."
27100_0,"'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' nearly defies definition! A cult classic, this send-up of alien invasion stories, pulp fiction heroes, and adventure movies is a love/hate proposition; while I found it to be brilliant fun, many of my friends thought it was incomprehensible! One thing for sure...There is NO other film quite like it! <br /><br />Buckaroo (played with laid-back coolness by Peter Weller) is a Japanese-American race car driver/neurosurgeon/rock star/comic book hero who, with his rock 'n roll commandos, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, balances his time between saving lives, pushing the boundaries of science, troubleshooting for the President, and playing gigs in nightclubs. The film careens from one climax to another, scarcely allowing the viewer time to think (which, in a film like this, may be a GOOD thing!). Director W.D. Richter deftly keeps the tone light, although there is a heartbreaking death scene tossed in. <br /><br />Loaded with more imagination than any three films you can name, and a oddball sense of humor, to boot, 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' is a wonderful, wacky triumph, that challenges you to toss aside preconceptions, and 'enjoy the ride'! <br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend it!<br /><br />"
27146_0,"An absolute waste of time for everyone involved(or should that be implicated), disgracefully boring, terrible in terms of plot, with characters being introduced, not even given a name, and not going anywhere, chubby cops doing Kung Fu, hilarious dialog (""I'm a private dick"") and the worst sin of all, uninspiring fights.<br /><br />The worst of it is, Eric Lee can actually be quite amusing, see his supporting roles in the first two 'Ring of Fire' movies, but here he proves that a leading man he is not, Gerald Okamura, one of these guys who seems to be a henchman in every martial arts film ever, is wasted as the titular villain with bad makeup.<br /><br />The story concerns some nonsense about a warrior fighting the master demon, being killed, but not before he cuts off the demon's hand and takes it to a temple where it is stowed away, until the box containing it is displayed at a museum, only to be stolen by Art Camacho(one of the worst directors in the history of history) and all hell breaks loose, with the warrior(possibly reincarnated, it never really says) recruiting the aforementioned chubby cop and 'Private Dick' to help him save the Earth, or space or something, the plot, if you want to call it that, isn't exactly good, or even competent.<br /><br />A boring, poorly made pile of pish that nobody in their right mind wants to watch."
27191_0,"Columbo episodes always seem to have the same formula. Especially since we know who does the crime after the first ten minutes, we love surprises in how Columbo catches his man or woman. In this episode, George Hamilton shows off his acting talents. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the man can act very well. He plays a psychiatrist who kills the husband of Lesley Ann Warren's character rather than ruin his reputation. The fun with Columbo episodes is that the crime is never too gruesome or motives are never too dark. Anyway, the doctor's patient is the prime witness and he gets her in the worst way. The crime happens at a beach-front estate secluded from neighbors and traffic. Anyway, watching Columbo catch him is particularly worth it especially sine you don't feel for Hamilton's character as a victim."

27371_0,"Behind the Mask takes place in the parallel world where scary movies live, and a team of young filmmakers set out to make a real life documentary about a serial killer at work. Such is their dedication to capturing realism that they are willing to follow the killer around and allow the murders to happen so that they can capture it all on tape. The movie is a fascinating and clever analysis of how the mind of a horror movie slasher works. <br /><br />More than anything else, the movie is a brilliant horror comedy in which Leslie Vernon, the main character, leads our film-making team through the whole process of how he pulls off the vintage horror-movie murders. It's basically an exploration of how those horror movie scenes are constructed. How the doors slam shut at just the right moment, how the perfect weapons are always available to the killer while the victim can't seem to find anything to protect himself or herself, and how the killer manages to let all the other promiscuous teenagers in the vicinity know that there is a killer on the loose and yet still manage to pick them off one by one.<br /><br />It also explores the history of the slasher genre, because Vernon is, of course, an avid horror movie buff, and idolizes all the great masked murderers. At one point in the movie, he claims that having Michael Myers and Freddy and Jason come back from the dead was a ""radical change in philosophy. Changed the whole business."" <br /><br />Nathan Baesel gives the perfect performance as Leslie Vernon. He's obviously disturbed and is also the product of a rape of his mother, but the most startling aspect of his character is how incredibly NORMAL he is. He laughs and jokes and talks to the film-making team as though they were making a documentary about his collection of rare toy cars than about his habit of brutally murdering large numbers of people. He's far too casual and easy-going to really be able to accept him as a serial killer (he even drives a Prius!), but that is the heart of the movie's charm.<br /><br />In the second half of the movie, however, the team decide that they were not as dedicated to their film as they thought they would be, and they decide that they can't just stand by and allow the killings to happen. In one of the movie's best scenes, Vernon stands there in full masked slasher get-up, mask and weapon and all, and scolds them like a babysitter scolding a naughty kid. <br /><br />It's hilarious the way he is so clearly offended by their behavior as he tells them that they have ""that 'we can't just stand here and let this happen' look on their faces"" and says that now they have to leave. <br /><br />Unfortunately, this is where the clever horror movie analysis ends and it turns into a more conventional slasher movie. The acting falls off a cliff and the killings stop making sense. But worst of all, having lost all of her footage, the remaining member of the documentary team at the end of the movie makes the bizarre and senseless decision to burn Vernon's body, I guess to destroy any remaining evidence of her crazy story, just in case she later had to explain any of this. <br /><br />But other than that, it's a unique and fresh look at the horror genre and a fun exploration of its history and methods."
27416_0,"Five Senses is a Canadian film noir playing at an art theater near you. Set against a gray fall Toronto background, it tells the stories of a menagerie of individuals leading frustrating, incomplete and unfulfilling existences. One of the five human senses [hearing, seeing, smelling, feeling or tasting] takes on a dominant role in the lives of several of the main characters. All the players have a relationship issue, or two, or three. The story is told around the central event of a missing person, although not all of the characters are directly involved. Five Senses is an award winning film in Canada, but to others it may be just an example of government effort to encourage creative film making [and thus indirectly censor and control content]. The story line has legs, but cannot walk. Each individual story is compelling, but few are fully developed. The `plot' is poorly structured, the main characters largely unrelated, and the message oblique. Finally, the movie has a stopping point, but not no real end. Robert Altman could have made this a masterpiece, but Jeremy Podeswa gives us only celluloid."

27506_0,"The Rose is about a woman whose sole purpose in life was to give of herself completely. Protected from adult responsibilities by her manager, ""Rose"" dug further and further inside herself, alienating all those who loved her. With an adolescent attitude toward life, she indulged in every excess. The poignant scene in the phone booth, where she overdoses on a lethal combination of pain killers, heroin, and booze is certainly worthy of an Academy Award. We feel her pain, and we really believe we are seeing a woman in the last hour of her life. Killing herself before our eyes, yet we are helpless to stop her. We can't stop watching. The final scene, and the final song Rose sings, Stay With Me, is filmmaking at its best. It sums up her life, and the life of so many talented musicians (Kurt Cobane, Jim Morrison, etc). Rose was desperate to have someone, anyone, who was there just for her. Yet she pushed everyone away who truly cared about her. Bette Midler's passionate and inspired performances in concert footage is unforgettable. The Rose is one of the best movies ever made."

I enjoy watching the episodes, they make me laugh at some points, and by the end of the episode I want to watch the next one to see what happens!! I suppose I like it so much because I didn't start watching the show having a standard of what it should be like fixed in my mind, so I wasn't disappointed. I hope at least it manages a whole first season rather than just about 13 episodes or what not. I'm up to episode 12 which was left on a slight cliffhanger about what was going on in my opinion and id be gutted if it ended like that!!"

If you enjoyed the first 2 CD movies, than you'll probably enjoy this.<br /><br />Note: I actually wanted to give this move 6.5, but there is no way to do that, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it a 7."
27641_0,"This is one of the better Tom and Jerry cartoons to prominently feature music. For some reason, whenever music was a focus, the short was usually excellent (examples include, Solid Serenade, Johann Mouse, Pecos Pest and, obviously, The Cat Concerto). Here, there's a hilarious song at the outset, over the opening credits and a bit later, Tom does his best impersonation of a cross between Tex Ritter and Milli Vanilli. Jerry, for a good many reasons, does his best to destroy Tom's romantic intentions (hey, what are ""friends"" for?) and largely succeeds. At cartoon's end, we leave amid the strains of another musical interlude and a twisted variation on an old cliche of the western genre and a good time is had by all, except Tom, of course. Well worth tracking down and most highly recommended."
27687_0,"If you don't like self-absorbed crazy people, this film isn't for you. You should probably also avoid moving to San Francisco, because he's not really that unusual by SF standards. I remember seeing him standing around in the Castro (at Hibernia Beach!) in the seventies. Even though it was an era of sexual freedom that we can barely conceive now, seeing him was shocking. The film doesn't really convey what it was like to see this caricature of male sex in his see-through pants with enormous basket on display. The first time that I saw him, I just kept thinking, ""Isn't he going to be arrested?"". Later that evening, I had other thoughts. I had no idea who he was until this movie came out, but that image is still burned into my brain. It was transfixing, and this film is a nostalgic look at the era that made him an icon."
27731_0,"Even though the film can never really top the brilliance of its own tagline ('Today the pond! Tomorrow the world!'), ""Frogs"" is a hugely entertaining and surprisingly well-made ecological horror film. These typical ""creature features"" were guaranteed hits back in the 70's and pretty much every animal species got turned into ravenous monsters enthusiast horror filmmakers, even the most unlikely ones like worms (""Squirm"") and rabbits (""Night of the Lepus""). In this film, the frogs aren't just vicious killers but also strategic army generals that mobilize a whole island's ecosystem to commit nasty murders! The frogs are merely supervising whilst humans are being killed off by spiders, lizards, snakes, alligators and  oh yes  even a turtle! Pickett Smith is a freelance photographer who ends up at the private island home of obnoxious industrialist Jason Crockett during his annual 4th of July/birthday celebration. Also present are a dangerously increasing amount of frogs that no longer put up with the pollution and pesticides on the island and they plan a large-scaled attack on the Crockett family. ""Ten Little Indians""-style, all the island's residents are imaginatively killed by ill-natured critters. The story naturally is silly and hardly ever scary, yet it's praiseworthy how director George McGowan attempts to build up an atmosphere of tension. Much like Hitchcock did in ""The Birds"" (only better), McGowan simply zooms in on the frogs and puts the emphasis on their eerie croaking. So, even though they're simple frogs they look a bit ominous! The best aspect of the film unquestionably is Mario Tosi's colorful camera-work that shows the beautiful environment from many creative viewpoints. The young Sam Elliot is quite good in his heroic role but the shows is obviously stolen by Ray Milland as the grumpy and bossy millionaire who thinks he can afford himself everything. The rest of the cast is quite wooden and their gruesome animal-inflicted deaths actually come as a relief. ""Frogs"" stands for great campy fun, not a single dull moment and a high body count! Damn, the 70's were cool."
27777_0,"Of course it was cheesy. They all are; but it was very entertaining. I loved the beginning when the old man got fried. I thought the movie was well done, except they did the behemoth in a little too easy. I guess they were running into time constrictions. The submarine was a little sub-par for chasing a sea monster. They were lucky they didn't take a nose dive just going out in the water with it. It's too bad they didn't have the behemoth escape and come back in a sequel to commit more carnage on the human species! I dream of the day when someone with a brain remakes this with modern techniques without ruining the movie as they did with Godzilla. Besides that, I love the name: THE GIANT BEHEMOTH!!!"

The music is also very cool, it will stay with you a long time after you see the film. Overall ""Escape From New York"" is a very fun action movie. *** out of ****."
27867_0,"Third episode of the legendary television series stars Dan Duryea as Al Denton. Al is a hopeless alcoholic in the Old West who was at one time a successful gunslinger. Now Al is ruthlessly made fun of by swaggering bully Dan Hotaling (Martin Landau). A mysterious peddler (Malcolm Atterbury) provides Al with two items - a gun and a potion - that just may affect his life for the better. And when Al's efficiency with a gun returns, a young hotshot named Pete Grant (Doug McClure) decides to challenge him.<br /><br />This episode worked so well for me because Duryea was a very (sym)pathetic figure. The actor makes the most of his role. As his story progresses, he's conscious of history repeating itself and what his ultimate destiny might be. (It's no accident that the peddler is named Mr. Fate.) The truth is that his redemption and second shot at life might come at a price. It's an emotional story that climaxes in an interesting and unexpected way. The ending is filled with hope which makes it all the more appealing.<br /><br />The actors on hand are quite entertaining. Jeanne Cooper of future 'The Young and the Restless' fame is the kindly Liz. Landau is a good deal of fun as the cruel Dan.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful episode.<br /><br />8/10"

28000_0,"Wilbur wants to kill himself is a killer movie. From someone who experiences suicidal ideation and tendencies on a daily basis, but is not depressed or in fear of those concepts, I found the film truthful. It gave me a reason to live, if for nothing else to see the end of the movie, but then again, if I were dead, I doubt that I would care. And that's the point. Wilbur captures a lot of that angst, and confusion.<br /><br />On the one hand he's someone the chicks dig (though I can't really see the 'it' thing that everyone talks about), and though he may know it, he also seems to realize the truest injustice in life: that we live in a world where we are alone and nothing matters and few others see that. Try as we might, it's difficult to find communion of any depth with any other person. Especially if you are a complex person in the least. Meaning, for instance, that if you have an interest in getting out of your small, middle America hometown, you are probably slightly more complex than most of your neighbors. You'll still have people to talk to, but your circle is dwindling.<br /><br />Let's say that you not only want to leave that hometown, but you're gay, well, I don't even have to go into what happens in this case. Suffice it to say, you're more complex than most, even if as a gay man, or lesbian woman you are simple.<br /><br />The thing is that being gay, and wanting to leave a hometown are relatively simple things compared to the person who has a deep, extra-ordinary, thought in their head about the quandary of life.<br /><br />For the purposes of dissecting this film's meaning, this is a person who can (or maybe can't help doing so) look at life and see it as something that really seems to have no purpose.<br /><br />If we have the ability to take that thought seriously, and investigate it for a very long time (dozens of years), without succumbing to the fear (or possibly in most cases, the reality) that it will lead to depression, or insanity, we will become more complex, because we will operate on a different level, and see things as they are. If we do this times ten, which would equate to us being very complex, we question life and its reasons more than just the standard ""why are we here"" rhetoric, we are likely never to find anyone who can relate to us, and worst of all, to whom we can relate without sensing our own dishonesty with our own self.<br /><br />And though I don't know for certain, it seems to me that this is the point at which Wilbur may have arrived. He also may not have. However, this characterization captures the real-life feeling of being in that state of knowing the purposelessness, and realizing that there are no answers in 'real' life that will suffice any longer, ever again. Realizing that ice cream doesn't make kids happy, balloons don't make kids happy, cars don't make adults happy. All of that simply serves to distract (in the form of conditioned responses) from the fact that we are raised as if on a farm to be automatons. When a person is at that point, the people with whom they connect are indeed rare.<br /><br />Everyone is familiar with the clichés about how many people there are for each person on the earth. For instance one says, ""There's someone for everyone."" Some people believe that. Some will say that for each person there are multiple possible partners, and for those people that's probably true. For some there are infinite partners. I guess in part it depends upon a person's underlying unconscious goals.<br /><br />For those for whom there can only be connection based on something truly undefined, to my satisfaction, by media and the like, there may be only one other person anywhere, or not at all, to whom they can relate. So, why live in a world where the process is the same everyday: get up, go to a silly job that serves some other bastard and his family but that we must take seriously in some way, come home, eat things (mostly out of habit), sleep, awake and do it all again. To top it all off, never ever meet a person that can see you. Never ever meet a person that even wants to see you. Never meet a person that acknowledges and knows true beauty in the form in which you bring it to this world.<br /><br />Why? Because they don't have the capacity, and you were never taught to look, you were only taught to take what is right in front of you. Wilbur might seem selfish, but I think that Wilbur might be sick of being judged based on some silly sexuality archetype that he carries because of habit, rather than real desire for it. Wilbur, like most of us, wants to be loved for who he is, by someone who does not judge him. I mean Wilbur's not sleeping around in this movie. So, obviously, he's looking for a connection that has more to do with something other than sex. There is a time when sex is just sex. There is a time when sex is procreative and therefore construed to be for love. Procreation does not always mean love.<br /><br />Best of all, there is also a time when sex is communion with another. A communion that transcends our own incarnations in bodies. It communicates, in concert with another, the confusion, the narcissism, the energetic component, the mechanical component, all while ""listening"" to another tell a similar story. At that point it is, for lack of a better conceptualization, art bonding souls. And there is no better reason to live or to choose to not live, than to be in proximity to the truth available in that possibility."
28046_0,"This really wouldn't look out of place as a student film. Leaden script, poor acting and a plot that never really gets going are just a few of the things that can be said. Caine is OK, but you get the feeling that the rest of the cast just don't care. In fact with better production values and a little more believable action this film could have been at least half-way decent. In the mid- to late-sixties there may have been a call for this type of film but not now. Then, it would have been slightly dangerous and risque, perhaps even exciting (then again perhaps not). Now it collects dust as it sits on the shelves of the local video outlet (really - it does!). The film is just a shadow of what could have been."
28091_0,"I found Ca Twiste to be very interesting. It's not that it was profound or prolific... It was just because I am an outsider looking in. These young-ones were Africans, as pure as can be, (given the fact that they've been colonized) and I'm a little all American ""tom-boy;"" ""Jack and Dianne in the American heartland"" rolled into one person. Do these people and I actually have something in common? I guess we do. We all have to live, learn, and grow, even if we are half-a-world-apart. But I digress, the movie is what is important, I supposed. It's sad really, or at least pathetic. For the first time in goodness knows how long I crave an American Hollywood-style ending. But Hollywood can't do anything right in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm just going to get right to it. The ending was- upsetting. I wanted more. The film just ends with the two children under the table making a reference to Ivanhoe that was lost on me. (Perhaps, if I had ever read that book, I could have understood it.) Thankfully, someone was there to explain it to me. The fighting between the quarrelsome children was over not because anything had been settled, but because they were sick of fighting. The voice over during the credits tells you how the kids grew up to love, laugh, and live elsewhere. That's how it ends: nice, pure, and simple.<br /><br />The voice over was the most meaningful part to me; it served as a reminder that we are being given a glimpse into a real somebody's personal life, and it should be treated with a form of respect and reverence akin to what one would give someone else's diary. This is why I don't have the heart to pick it apart like a normal critique would."
28136_0,"I find myself disgusted at myself for watching this film. I literally feel as filthy as the people engaged in the acts portrayed in the film.<br /><br />However, sitting in judgment while watching the torture scenes I find myself drawn into their world because I too want to find the offspring of everyone involved and break every bone in their body and burn their skin and dismember their sexual organs.<br /><br />So obviously we can all be driven to cruelty and somehow feel justified in our feelings. We wonder how societies can turn and things like the Holocaust can happen, how the torture of terror suspects by our own current administration can take place while we all sit idly by.<br /><br />It reminds me of one thing, we are the only animals on this planet capable of torture. No other animal purposely imposes pain-most won't even kill their own species, yet we humans with our philosophies and religions find a way to be so pompous and arrogant to believe we are the master species of the planet. That we deserve some ""afterlife"" or blessing from a creator. If there is an intelligent creator-he/she/it would just set us all ablaze after seeing the things we do.<br /><br />After seeing this I know this for sure, we are the filth of this earth, we are an infestation that does not deserve to live because all of us can turn a blind eye to cruelty to save our own asses. We always seem to find a way to justify cruelty to not only our own kind, but every living thing on this planet.<br /><br />Wow, I feel like a real piece of crap tonight. Just for being human.<br /><br />Is that how this movie was supposed to make me feel? WTF? WTF? WTF? I am sure there is some excuse for that woman like she was raped by her daddy or tortured or whatever, but when bad things happen to you doesn't that make you want to be better than that? I am so mindf**ked by this movie I don't even know what to think.<br /><br />I am going to go vomit now.<br /><br />(I did have to add this)<br /><br />The film was masterfully done. The actors drew me in like I was there. I haven't literally ""talked"" to a screen in years. I did this time. Those actors doing the evil really made me hate them. I don't even know if I could look those actors in the eye without that feeling creeping over me if I ran into them in an airport-that is how engrossed I became in this story. The foster mother in this story plays the role incredibly. I will have nightmares about her face. Those kids were little bastards to a degree that is unbecoming an actor of their ages.<br /><br />The movie is disturbing and believable. Hardly anything left to the imagination. If I had to give it a name to reflect what it was about and the horror it portrayed I would say, ""Nazi-American Family Auschwitz""<br /><br />I did not want to leave my ""vomit"" comment as my opinion of the film itself. The film is really well done, but you feel filthy for watching it."
28181_0,"South Park is one of my favorite TV shows, so I decided I had to see the movie. Once the movie started I was into it very quickly. (This part contains Spoilers) In the beginning, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie that is made by their idols, Terrence and Philip. The film is a little bit more than just a lot of foul language. After the kids see it, they start swearing all the time and tell their friends about it. Soon, a lot of kids in the country see it and also start swearing. The parents become very concerned about this. One day Kenny does something similar to what happens in the movie and ends up getting killed. The kid's Moms decide to start a war against Canada and execute Terrence and Philip. If I told you the rest, it would ruin the fun of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a musical with some very clever and hilarious musical numbers, one of which was nominated for an academy award. The storyline is very clever, looking at how much came out of such a simple idea. At the same time this movie does have some good points that were brought up, such as how people think media makes kids to do things, and about freedom of speech. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it is definitely a clever movie with some huge laughs and good messages."
28226_0,"When this film was released in 1933, the majority of reviews were negative and even hostile. The film was hated and vilified; audiences and theatre owners found it tacky and cheap. They missed the whole point. The film is a sharp satire of both the Mellerdrammers of the early twentieth century and of studio filmmaking. Fields and Bruckman were too incisive as comics not to have done everything in this film very deliberately. From the overly obvious sets to the absolute WORST background projection ever seen, the film is a sly poke in Hollywood's eye and that's where its humor comes from. I just about wet myself the first time I saw Fields go out to ""milk the elk"". He stands in front of a background projection of elk in the snow and begins calling to them. When they start to run, they grow larger and larger, dwarfing the non-plussed Fields. Sadly, since this is a public domain title, it's hard to find a good copy of it. About the best I've seen is on the ""6 Films by W.C. Fields"" LD or DVD"
28271_0,"Literally. Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott was a little gem of a book which could not be pigeon-holed into a specific genre over a hundred and fifty years ago and as a result ended up on Science Fiction shelves. Combining Geometry and Philosophy (and even Religion), it was an allegory on the human condition, describing a very rigidly-structured Society where square pegs aspired to fit through round holes.<br /><br />The plot focuses on A. Square, who is led to a series of epiphanies on the Nature of Reality itself to the realization that not only is there an existence beyond his two-dimensional plane in the form of a 3-dimensional universe, but that further dimensions are implied. He learns that appearances are not necessarily all they seem.<br /><br />Difficult to conceptualize in its reading, Llad Ehlinger, Jr. has managed to graphically express this evolution of the mind. Despite these worlds being populated exclusively by geometric shapes, we are drawn into the story and feel A. Square's transformation as though it were our own, which it hopes to be. Flatland itself is appropriately extremely two-dimensional, yet has endearing qualities. From our hero's perspective, he is at first confused, then exhilarated as he is lifted into the three-dimensional world. We are taken along for the dizzying ride. This is only the beginning for A. Square, who then postulates other worlds with both less and more dimensions. Ehlinger has a sequence which can only be an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey as multi-dimensionality is explored.<br /><br />As if this were not a big enough task to tackle, Ehlinger expands the storyline by applying some of the original concepts of Governments to their logical path to War. Flatland, both the book and the movie, can be appreciated at many levels. By adding an extra layer, Ehlinger has actually simplified the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie. It is mind-bending and thought-provoking, with a graphic element integral to its message. A potentially too-heavy treatise is lightened by very humorous details, such as the warbled battle cries of female lines in Flatland, who need to both sway and make noise at all times in order to be seen when not approached from their sides, so as not to pierce unobservant polygons! There is more than meets the eye to this unusual independently filmed and marketed movie. One viewing may not be enough."
28316_0,"Why anyone would be at all willing to defend this piece of tripe is beyond me. Is that a rude statement, designed to evoke a defensive response in people with poor taste in films - or no taste at all? No. It is, quite simply, the statement of a fact: I do not understand why anyone would enjoy this film.<br /><br />I've no idea what the film was shot on, but the video quality is equivalent to that of 1.5 hours worth of America's Funniest Home Videos. The music was god-awful, repetitive and annoying. Who would actually LISTEN to this stuff? And, the acting. Here is where this pile truly shines. Every line seems forced and awkward, read or poorly memorized instead of being acted. Any casting director who worked on this film would be forced into suicide after viewing it, so I can agree with another poster who took the opinion that these actors are the director's friends, or friends of friends.<br /><br />What about the story? Well... what about it? There's really nothing to talk about here. Only the first 20 minutes or so of the film have anything at all to do with ghosts or ""ghost watching."" After that it's all exposition involving characters we know nothing about due to extremely poor characterization. Then again, I guess good characterization isn't really possible when the film is acted by people who would merely call that a ""big word,"" and not attempt to understand its meaning.<br /><br />Do not waste your time with this piece of dreck. The music, story, filming, acting, lighting, sound... it's all absolutely terrible. $4 for a rental was, quite simply, the worst $4 I have ever spent.<br /><br />- J"
28361_0,"One night a group of friends, more or less go out for a night on the town in New York City. This low budget film explore their lives and where they are going in life. There are four main characters: There is Tom, an aspiring actor, Willie, a welfare case always insisting the white man is keeping him down, Fernando, a Puerto Rican womanizer who passes himself as Italian, and Johnny, a neighborhood supermarket employee who knows there is something better.<br /><br />These four people go out on the town and run into various people, problems, but this night proves to be something different from every other night they go out. This movie is so good because it manages to be funny while having some real good points. The acting here is excellent and the script is excellent. <br /><br />The characters all are realistic. Johnny, seems to be a real nice guy, and seems to be the nicest out of all of them. Tom is the second nicest to me, as he tries to do the right thing, but sometimes is a little sidetracked. Willie is a decent man who hasn't yet learned to get off his ass and work, while Fernando, who tries to pass for Italian is a straight up prick. <br /><br />The movie looks at so many issues, from education, to ethnicity. There are many different things this movie talks about, and there is not a happy ending, something that is pretty cool. It just kind of ends, and you really don't know where it goes after the ending, well you do and you don't. The movie is unique like that. <br /><br />Overall this is an excellent low budget movie with a lot to offer. The movie is all acting too, no violence or elaborate action sequences, making this movie nice and quaint. The movie has a lot to offer and I recommend it highly."
28406_0,"In a posh apartment building there seems to be more to a bizarre murder/suicide than first apparent. When this proves to be the case a scheme by an eccentric biology researcher to fund his project come to light and we see what led to the initial grisly murder. The resulting aftermath is even more horrifying.<br /><br />David Cronenberg's first feature film has all the visceral themes of his early works and they are executed with a vengeance. Venturing far into dark and unsettling horror territory Cronenberg crafts a spiraling nightmare of zombie outbreak and promiscuous sex. The film is almost a prelude to the much revered ""Dawn of the Dead"" by George Romero as it shows the beginning of a zombie outbreak. It is also better and much richer in its story and horror metaphor though the characterizations are slightly more shallow than in ""Dawn of the Dead."" But the presentation of the irrational horror and unsettling gore is at least on par with ""Dawn,"" despite this film's many obvious limitations.<br /><br />That makes for a must see for horror fans and this is a great first film from a great director. 9/10<br /><br />Rated R for graphic violence and gore"
28451_0,"So add badly done zombies, a villain taken from the old ""House"" movies, and cookie-cutter characters. What do you get??? A flick that makes ""House of the Dead"" look like an art-house film.... First off, there is very little connection between the opening scene. The acting was, of course, horrible. There was the science chick who kept looking for a logical explanation to why her friends were being eaten. There was the redneck. The pretty girl who lives just long enough (but no nudity to make it worthwhile). It looks like the budget was so low, they filmed it during one afternoon. Finally, there is a hybrid scene that combines elements from Scarface and Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately it was sewn together with a safety pin. A high school film club would be ashamed of this dog."
28497_0,"Much inequity in this world that takes away any chance of survival for millions of worthy brethren, much selfishness that brings only misery and loneliness!, Appearance and how much desire to feel superior to others when it will show us we are all equal! <br /><br />At this very moment, thousands of human beings roam the streets in search of a few coins incessant to bring home food minimum. Hundreds of people walk long miles to get the scarce water that allows them to survive. Millions of workers are unemployed, from one side to another, with the gray hope that someone offered a decent job.<br /><br />When I remember the old movies, my memory goes back Umberto D, vainly trying to stop the eviction. I remember Ali and his sister Zahra, in permanent anxiety about the tennis shoes worn they share.And behold, with its immense sensitivity to the common people and humanistic lyricism that flowed constantly, also the master Akira Kurosawa was busy making a film where, for a rookie detective, your weapon becomes endowment constant goal, when it was stolen on a bus. <br /><br />Have a long way to go then, but life will put his hand to a noble and brilliant detective Satori.

28541_0,"Powder Keg is most unlike the other BMW films. It's as different in its way as Star was. Where Star was humorous and light, Powder Keg is dark and bloody. The first of the films that deserves and R Rating, it has profanity and violence unlike the others; sensitive viewers beware. That said, its story is well written. The photographer's sense of frustration over not having done enough to help those he photographs, the oppressive presence of armed militia everywhere, the desperate need to make the border against overwhelming forces, and most of all, the bloody back seat of the vehicle, all paint a picture of doom and gloom for the characters. The scene at the end with the mother explains the earlier comment by the photographer, ""My mother taught me to see."" The driver's feelings of loss and failure, assuaged not at all by delivering the dog tags, is well acted out.<br /><br />I hope this isn't the end for this fine series."
28587_0,"Many people seem to regard this film as important simply because it is a living testament to Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontaine's acting. After all, it is the only preserved sound performance in which they have starring roles. In reality, however, the film is not only historically important because of the legends in it; it is one of the most fresh and funny films to emerge from the pre-Code period. The story is irresistible: a vain acting couple constantly insult and tease one another. In order to test his wife's fidelity after a bout, the Actor (Lunt) disguises himself as a foreign guardsman, goes out of his way to meet his wife in disguise, and furthermore goes on to try and seduce her. After he succeeds, he reveals himself, furious at her perfidious attitude. The Actress (Fontaine) begins laughing, claiming that she knew all along. At first dubious, the Actor is eventually convinced that his wife was playing along with him, and the two romantically embrace. The Actress looks at the camera and gives the most priceless look, letting the audience know that she may not have really known all along... Lunt and Fontanne make this film come to life. There dominating presence creates a satirical and realistic portrait of what an egomaniacal acting couple's life might really be like. <br /><br />In addition, there are some priceless supporting roles: Maude Ebourne as a sarcastic maid, Zasu Pitts as a strange (to say the least) servant, Roland Young, and always-reliable Herman Bing as ""a creditor."" Sidney Franklin, perhaps the most unjustly forgotten of all screen directors (his classics include Private Lives, Smilin' Through, The Good Earth, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, and The Dark Angel), adroitly guides the ensemble, allowing the acting to take center-stage but never neglecting the details so important to cinema. In all, this short, fast-paced romp with two bona fide legends of American stage history is an essential lesson in screen comedy and romance. Although the Lunts, when asked to do later film work, replied ""We can be bought but we can't be bored!"" there is absolutely no sign of unenthusiasm on screen here. Each earned an Oscar nomination for their performance in The Guardsman, and they left their indelible stamp, albeit only for a short eighty some-odd minutes, on American motion picture history."

28677_0,"Just when it seems that cinema has descended yet again into the deep abyss of zero plot combined with tons of special effects performed by pretty boys and pop tarts with no acting abilities whatsoever to disguise the fact that it is trash, something new comes along to uplift the entire sorry state of modern film and restore the discerning audience's faith in the true art of the cinema. I attended just such a performance at the 24th August 2005 premiere screening of Gypo in the UK at the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF) and found it to be a powerful dramatic piece (the first British one) from the recent Dogme genre of film making. According to its manifesto, Dogme rules reject special effects, scripted and formulaic acting, and films all scenes in ambient light to make the actors rather than post- production additions drive the plot. Told from the points of view of the wife Helen, the husband Paul and the Czech immigrant Tasha, the story of the disintegration of a working-class British family from Margate while encountering newly-arrived refugee immigrants, makes for some gritty, gripping entertainment. As the film covers the same events from three differing points of view, the plot is gradually fleshed out and brought to a most surprising conclusion. Nothing is as it originally appears. Be prepared to be surprised and absorbed completely in the unfolding, many-layered story.<br /><br />Pauline McLynn, usually known for her comedic acting in the UK, gives a tour de force drama performance as the frustrated, ineffective-feeling wife Helen. One feels her frustration when her husband and teenage daughter use her in various ways and make fun of her attempts to find her inner creative self in sculpture classes. When she meets Tasha, we are allowed to see her caring and compassionate side in reaching out for those less fortunate still. Paul McGann portrays the simmering angry, repressed, frustrated breadwinner who hates change yet despises his limited, impoverished, meaningless existence of doing carpet installation day jobs. Alternating between stony silence and lashing out in bigoted epithets at ""Gypos"" whom he feels (incorrectly) take his jobs, McGann portrays a total bastard with whom one may still feel some sympathy. Perhaps, he might have filled some of the silent scenes with more lines, but his performance was generally quite solid. Relative acting newcomer Chloe Sirene, actually London-born, also gives a fantastic and completely convincing performance as the Romany Czech refugee, Tasha, struggling against ethnic hatred and pursuing male relatives to gain British citizenship, independence, and find her way in an impoverished and hostile area. Even though a teen the age of Helen's daughter, she shows great strength and resilience in the face of great adversity. The supporting cast also give very solid performances that add texture to the developing story line.<br /><br />Hopefully, this excellent film will make its way into American theaters, at the very least the Art Theater circuit, in the next year. This deserving film definitely should be added to everyone's must-see list."
28721_0,"Contrary to another review, this show is suitable for anyone who might watch TV. Unlike the septic sludge of today the children are depicted in a reasonably innocent childhood. However, it should be noted that there is one element of unspeakable filth that must be addressed - the father's hobby is collecting . . . . T-O-I-L-E-T-S. Shhhhhh.<br /><br />So if you find such filthy hobbies offensive turn off your TV, pick it up, and throw it out the window because this program is as tame as it gets.<br /><br />This is an EXCELLENT Program for ALL ages. (I love this show - and I'm 51.) It is unfortunate that The Wayne Manifesto has not been made available to a larger audience and/or on DVD.

28767_0,"This movie is a masterpiece of 1980's comedies. It has everything you want in an 80's film. Washed up actors like Scott Baio and Willie Aames (who are actually funny in the film) super hot Heather Thomas that can give a gay man a hard on, plenty of great 80's songs that you never heard of, a prom scene, a sports cliche, plenty of flopping breasts, and Scatman Crothers. This movie came out back when R rated films made money. The film was PG and then they added some boobies to make it rated R. Today, Solaris was given an R just for showing George Clooney's liberal behind (it was later revoked to PG-13). Back then, producers knew that kids wanted to see large, oval shaped tater tots and kids drinking and going bonkers. This movie would be great to show with such flawless films as Bachelor Party, Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, and Three O'Clock High. Forget American Pie and Old School, watch the REAL films that started them all. WOW!"

Even your teenagers will like this(although they may roll their eyes in disbelief when they find out its in black and white!). The movie is a tasty blend of slapstick humor, the perils of interpersonal relationships and a particularly brilliant bit of artifice involving a mantel and a doll-(keep an eye out for it towards the end of the movie-it happens rather quickly!) I suppose it sounds trite to say it-but this film is just plain, good, old-fashioned, clean fun. I think it is a timeless classic that will continue to appeal to audiences in the future."

A new group of agents work with Alex and they keep receiving death threats against President Jonathan Hayes again played by the gorgeous Gregory Harrison.Brandy Ledford gives a stunning performance as Agent Kelsey, who Alex always pushes around to toughen her up. Two assassins are hired by someone to make a perfect plan on killing the President, but first they intend to lure him to Seattle where they have people on the inside to help kill the President. A very handsome Aaron Grain stars as Evan, one of the assassins. Action packed sequel to First Daughter. I was looking forward on watching this and now I'll wait for the 3rd part! I just keep wondering why there isn't a love interest yet for the President since he did say in the first movie that he is a widower. I thought sparks would fly between him and Alex, but hey no such luck. It would be interesting to see that. This movie was good, but I don't think Daryl Hannah will be in the 3rd movie and it was also interesting to see the President trying to set Alex and Grant up."

28947_0,"`The Right Stuff' is the story of the original Mercury 7 astronauts and their journey through the fledgling NASA program and eventually into space. It is well-written and well-acted, featuring a veritable `Who's Who' of then slightly unknown actors such as Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn and Lance Henriksen. While it had an over three hour running time, and I actually had to get up to turn over the DVD because of its length, the pacing was such that I never once considered that any particular scene should have been shortened. One thing I particularly enjoyed about the film was the introduction of Chuck Yeager (Shepard) and his contribution to history by breaking the sound barrier, and then the periodic simultaneous comparison of the accomplishments of the astronauts and the Air Force and civilian test pilots, as well as exhibiting their eventual mutual respect.<br /><br />If I had to point out any kind of glaring fault, it would have to be that they focused on some astronauts more than others  obviously concentrating heavily on the bigger names, and glossing over the `lesser-known' ones. An example would be Walter Schirra (Henriksen)  his name is mentioned a couple of times, and he probably had a tenth of the screen time of the others. Plainly, with an already three hour running time not everyone could have equal time, so this is certainly a mild criticism. `The Right Stuff' isn't profound or exceptional, but it is certainly a good and interesting film.<br /><br />--Shelly"
28992_0,"I was warned this movie would be emotional, but I had no idea just how understated that was. By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before. It was a mix of horror, empathy, sadness, and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.<br /><br />Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).<br /><br />I strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I've seen, anime or not."
29036_0,"Strangler's handling of deadpan, grotesque cruelty and black humour is somewhat similar to the mixture Alex de la Iglesia would perfect in his movies a decade later. The tonal shifts from horror to humour and back again are done well, with only an occasional unevenness, but the film's artificiality (voiceover narration, intertitles, grotesque exaggeration, etc.) may alienate some viewers. Sijan is to be commended for his courage in parodying a genre that has never been too popular with Serbian moviegoers in the first place. Strangler's thematic and stylistic subversiveness was part of the fresh air in Serbian cinema at the time, inspired by the New Wave movement: a wide front of artists and critics based around Belgrade's Student Cultural Center, involved in alternative rock'n'roll, literature, arts and the movies.<br /><br />The picture was shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival in the mid-'80s, and I was surprised to meet an American poet there who could recite memorable lines from Strangler a full twenty years later (some of them in Serbian!). It is a testament to this film's lasting power which, unfortunately, remains limited only to Serbian filmgoers since an English-dubbed DVD is still nowhere in sight."
29081_0,"Sitting down for Macbeth the Comedy I was rather expecting a kind of Iris Murdochesque production, full of in-jokes about Shakespeare and Macbeth in particular. How wrong I was. Macbeth: The Comedy takes Shakespeare's well-crafted tale and adds a liberal sprinkling of modern low-level American humour. Apart from lots and lots and lots (many) jokes about gays and lesbians there was an attempt to lace the movie with slapstick comedy, presumably lightening the scene. This didn't work at all, being more the kind of slaphead comedy that doesn't make it much onto tv any more. I was pleasantly surprised to find no toilet humour, but the tone wasn't held much about that with much sniggering concerning the abovementioned lesbian and gay characters in the film: for which one must assume there is a reason. Somewhere."
29126_0,"Although I use the words Real World, this movie is more realistically a fantasy of what real love is often dreamed about. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as I watched it late night on cable. And Although I had seen it before a few other times , I really never paid much attention to it. I just knew that every other time I had it on, that somehow I was forced to stay tuned. And it finally paid off. The acting of the principals was superb. Chenoa Maxwell is a fox. Christopher Cherot is a multitalented up and coming young Black Filmmaker. And although I had to tone down the sound because I didn't want the neighbors to hear all the profanity, in spite of this, I thought they did an excellent job. It was warming to see this movie where two people finally admit to themselves that they were hopelessly in Love with each other. It ended up just the way real people ""dream"" of. Unfortunately in the real World it seldom happens that way. Shucks...I felt like falling in love with Hav myself."
29171_0,"Of all the Disney franchises my favorite has to be Duck Tales. Many people think that Duck Tales was merely an 80s TV show and never went further than Saturday morning but in reality it has a very rich history going back decades and if you think that it spoofs Indiana Jones you'd be wrong because it's actually the other way around.<br /><br />Darkwing Duck was a spin-off of Duck Tales, taking place in the same universe but transplanting the action from Duckburg to St. Canard. The only regular returning character was bumbling pilot Launchpad McQuack but he was my favorite, though Gizmoduck does make a couple of appearances.<br /><br />Darkwing himself, ordinary Drake Mallard by day, is a sort of cross between Batman, The Scarlet Pimpernel and The Shadow. He's a crime-fighter with absolutely no abilities other than his determination to beat the bad guys though his is utterly confident in himself and craves media attention. With Launchpad as his sidekick and the occasional help from his daughter Goslyn he tackles a variety of strange villains, winning usually by chance.<br /><br />I've often thought that a hero can only be measured by his nemesis and unfortunately none of the Darkwing Duck bad guys are up to much, but that's fine since Darkwing himself is sort of incompetent. Episodes set during the daytime contradict the noirish nature of the show and the best episodes are the ones set in the shadows and dark alleyways. I know that this is a kids show and is not necessarily in the same league as the Batman animated series but it does seem to be selling itself short in this regard. Duck Tales frequently had very dynamic and imaginative stories while Darkwing Duck is sort of hit-and-miss. That's my only complaint though.<br /><br />Darkwing Duck still has loads going for it, including a brilliant theme song and his memorable signature catchphrase 'Let's get dangerous' (or 'It's gonna get scary big-time' as they say in France). There still life in this bird yet and with the Scrooge McDuck universe still popular to this day then we might just see him return some time."
29216_0,"I really enjoyed this movie. Most Hollywood dance movies are very poorly done, simply because they rarely cast anyone with the requisite training to make the dancing sequences enjoyable, believable, or even worth watching. Ballet is not something you can pick up in 6 months of intense training. Prior to watching the movie, I looked up the lead actress, and was delighted to find she actually has had classic dance training. That became very clear, watching her dance. The movie does have a few nice plot twists, as far as the relationships of the key characters. I also enjoyed the portrayal of Julliard.<br /><br />Excellent movie, if you enjoy dance, and, have danced, or been involved with the world of ballet, or modern dance."
29261_0,"Sure, I sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do trust me. The only real reason everybody is hating on this film is because it's a DTV movie. But you could watch it and not know that at all because it's just about as good as other Action movies currently out there. <br /><br />Now, I know Wesley Snipes has been losing most of his appeal due to questionable roles and the recent bombs ""Blade: Trinity"" and ""Unstoppable ( A.K.A. 9 Lives )."" But I saw him in this film and a film, that has yet to be released in the U.S. called ""Chaos."" <br /><br />Anyway, this film never lets up on the thrills and is probably worth seeing for anyone into Crime Thrillers as well because this film is all about heists, car chases and back-stabbings. If you're not into that sort of thing thats been done before in ""Ronin"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" then you won't find anything different here. <br /><br />For fans of the last two films I mentioned, you might find your needs satisfied here. Director Simon Bellows uses slick video-editing and electronic music to accompanie the martial-arts and gun battles & he does a solid job w/ what he has to work with. <br /><br />Beware, even though I saw this on USA cable network edited, it is still a pretty violent flick w/ suggested sex & f-bombs ( I could tell what they just said even though it was bleeped out on regular T.V.) so I recommend this for more mature viewers. <br /><br />Rent it or watch it when it airs on T.V. because it's a decent hour-and-a-half of your time."
29306_0,"If you watch this movie expecting a gore fest in the likes of Gozu and Ichi, you will be very surprised. Compared to Miike's others, Sukiyaki Western is like Bambi when it comes to gore and dementia. While I expected something else, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. When it comes to blood, Miike followed the old saying of ""quality, not quantity"". It is very tastefully done and certainly is one of the more original movies of our time. Miike really went the artistic route with this one. The entire movie utilizes a unique style of cinematography and uses colors that are symbolic to the plot.<br /><br />My copy of the movie was imported from Singapore. I haven't seen anyone mention the obvious flaw with the subtitles, so I'll assume it is unique to my copy. Like the other reviews said, the spoken word of the movie can be very hard to understand since the actors are speaking a language other than their native tongue, but when I turned on the subtitles, they turned out to be almost completely nonsensical! They read like a computer's bad translation mixed with Yoda-speak. The words related to what was being said, but they did not make sentences. It was very strange, and added a whole other atmosphere to the movie, probably unintentionally. Hopefully I stumbled on some sort of rare edition of the movie."
29351_0,"This is a great contender for the best of the worst. People go to investigate a murder and look for treasure on Snape Island. The gore is pretty graphic if you see a decent version of this movie and the atmosphere is very spooky. An island with just a lighthouse and some spooky caves underneath is a great idea and they use the suspense well. I have NO idea why it got banned in Finland. It is a very funny film as well. Loads of mistakes and a stereotypical cornish sailor named Hamp.<br /><br />''SPOILERS''<br /><br />When one of the girls come in and say 'Dinners Ready' with a bunch of plates there is nothing on the plates at all and why does she drop them all just because she can hear what sounds like a flute playing?!<br /><br />A character named Brom breaks every horror movie rule ever...He drinks, Smokes crack, takes bribes, lies, has sex, tries to steal a bunch of treasure until he gets killed!<br /><br />Hamp the sailor doesn't smile throughout the entire movie until near the end and he gets killed.<br /><br />The boat that there sailing to the island looks like its floating way above the water!<br /><br />Robin Askwith trying to be american.

29397_0,"This is a cheap looking Italian drama about three girls who are taken hostage by three criminals. It really isn't that interesting, although there are a couple of enjoyable moments. The girls take revenge and kill the dudes cold, but that isn't where it ends. The final sequence is one of the only parts that leave an impression.<br /><br />I stumbled on this movie by accident and watched it once. There were some lengthy sequences that did not keep my attention. It was gritty and poorly lit, and not very scenic.<br /><br />It starts out kind of carefree, as the three girls are on a vacation bus with a group, but stay behind from the rest to hang out at a beach house. They meet three men and it's kind of cozy for a while. The movie changes tone midway when the girls find out the men are wanted. <br /><br />I think I only watched this because it was an obscurity. There are plenty of mainstream movies that are more fun than this."
29441_0,"Unfortunately I saw this marvelous film on TV last night-unfortunate because it was on the small TV screen and not a large movie screen. I admit it-I am totally taken by period pieces whose setting is somewhere in Latin America and if those movies have good sets and/or locations then I am smitten. Original Sin, set in Cuba and filmed in Mexico had the visuals down perfect-throw in the acting of Jolie and Banderas and you have a visual feast.<br /><br />The book/script were fabulous vehicles for the acting of the majors as well as a framework that works beautifully for the intrigues that pepper this film. This script should keep viewers interested throughout and I will definitely be renting this film so that I can savour it without interminable commercials. I want to wallow in the beauty of the images and settings at least one more time.<br /><br />Any viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released."

29531_0,"Now and then a badly made film is so incredibly inept that it becomes hilariously funny and attains cult movie status. But for the most part, badly made films are just bad plain and simple, and BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA is a case in point.<br /><br />The story line is similar to the Crosby-Hope films of the 1940s. Two entertainers accidentally walk out of an airplane in flight and find themselves on a strange tropical island. How strange is it? Well, it's so strange that Bela Lugosi lives there, and he's trying to find a way to turn men into monkeys. One of the native girls is the banana of Lugosi's eye, and when she takes a fancy to one of the stranded song-and-dance men you can pretty much bet the guy is about to become a laboratory experiment.<br /><br />The problem with the movie isn't so much the story as it is the actual script, which is dreadful, and the cast, which is worse. The lines are dumb rather than funny and the cast--most notably Sammy Petrillo in his tooth-gritting Jerry Lewis imitation--is abrasive rather than funny. Petrillo's partner in this crime is actor Duke Mitchell, who is equally tiresome as a low-rent imitation of Dean Martin. As for Bela Lugosi, he may get title billing, but there's not much to the role, and that may actually be for the best.<br /><br />There are several DVD releases of this film, some with bonuses, some without, some good quality prints, some lousy. But to my mind it doesn't matter: no matter how you look at this thing, it's worth paying money so you DON'T have to watch it. A cult favorite? I don't know who gives it that accolade, but believe me when I say they can have it.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
29577_0,"In the realm of ""S-M""/""B & D"" (i.e. women getting physically restrained and then usually abused in various ways) this can be viewed as a kind of ""missing link"" between the Irving Klaw/Bettie Page classics of the early to mid 1950's and the gems from House of Milan/TAO in the 1970's and 1980's (the latter still being regarded by yours truly as the exemplar of the genre). Apparently it's part three of a trilogy, but I've just seen the one (which probably won't change). As you probably already know, the alleged story concerns a crime boss named Olga who spends most of her time punishing various female subordinates for various off-screen infractions. It upholds the John Willie/Eneg tradition of the all-female universe, although we do briefly see a couple of quasi-gay male characters, one of whom wears a ship captain's hat and smokes a big cigar---overcompensation? Even by Z-grade budget standards, the faked nature of the abuse performed by Olga is pretty laughable; I especially enjoyed the pulled punches/slaps. (How hard would it have been for the director to have Olga put her hand next to the victim's face, yank it back suddenly, then show that particular footage in reverse?) The ""electric chair"" also stands out (or sits) in that regard. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of just 1 is due to a few aesthetically pleasing elements; the cinematography is gorgeous old-school black and white (not like today's occasional black and white efforts that look like crap); the outdoor shots of upstate New York are a nice relief from the largely bare-walled interior scenes (it's a nice touch having Olga's hide-out be an abandoned mine, although clearly the rooms seen aren't in a mine); there's a long (and blessedly dialog-free) sequence of one of the victims getting chased through the countryside that almost achieves a kind of pastoral quality, reminiscent of the silent era; most of the women are fairly easy on the eye, especially Olga (who by the way is clearly American despite her foreign-sounding name). Late in the going we see Olga let her hair down and start to undress as she gets ready for bed; unfortunately no auto-eroticism ensues (well it was still 1964 and all that). There's also a scene of some amateurish belly dancing tossed in, for fans of that particular activity. If you're a male who will be watching this for masturbatory purposes (I don't know who else would be watching it, or why else) I would suggest turning the volume all the way down and playing your own ""stroke music"" on your CD player or whatever you have, unless you're heavily into ""Night on Bald Mountain"" (and other old library tunes) and lots of self-satirizingly earnest narration a la Walter Winchell on ""The Untouchables,"" e.g. ""Olga was now about to achieve a new level of sadism,"" pronounced ""sad-dism."" (That line's probably not verbatim, but you get the idea.) Even on just a technical bondage level it's pretty lame (aside from the lady in the strait-jacket with the blindfold and ball gag); soap operas do a more convincing job of binding & gagging. Here's the ""spoiler"" part: eventually one of the victims becomes Olga's partner ---but do any nice lesbian antics ensue? No way, Jose--bottom line, it's a pretty bare-bones 70 minutes; even describing the ""tortures"" would make them sound more interesting than they actually play out, one reason I haven't done so..."
29621_0,"Though the script could have used a rewrite, mainly to upgrade the dialogue, Warren William's presence makes the film worth watching. He plays a lying, evil, conniving, and utterly ruthless human dynamo who works his way up from janitor to international power broker.In other words, a typical Depression-era anti-hero. Especially enjoyable is the penultimate flashback sequence, in which William remembers every rotten thing he's ever done. In a word, fun."
29667_0,"Even though the movie is corny, it still sends a message that love will prevail. Family means everything and without their support, love and consideration, life will be harder. Just knowing that your family loves you and what you love, makes facing the world that much easier.<br /><br />I compare this to My Big Fat Greek Wedding in cultural attributes. There is a world out there of give and take and for the most part, I feel people have forgotten that. These two movies show that consideration and the almighty give and take are important to long-lasting relationships in any culture, religion and family.<br /><br />I recommend watching this movie with an open mind, hoping to laugh, love, cry and remember how to have a healthy relationship and I hope this inspires you to have consideration for others in your world."
29711_0,"Man, what a time to grow up! The 1980's were a fabulous time for, not only, music, and films, but television as well. There was no better television station in the 1980's than The USA Network! USA ""Up All Night"" was amazing! Since I was too young to really go out, and party, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, I would sit at home, or at a friends house and watch this show every weekend. I loved how atrocious the 'B' movies were, and the hilarious comments both Gilbert Godfried and Rhonda Shear used to make about the film.<br /><br />USA's late night television blocks were AMAZING on weekends. I can vividly remember getting excited, every Saturday, from about 1988-1993, to watch The USA Network from 8PM until, at least 3AM.<br /><br />As a teenager that loved horror films, what could've been better than USA's Saturday Nightmares block (8PM-11PM) and then, USA ""Up All Night"" which ran from 11PM-3AM. Blood and guts from 8-11 and T&A from 11PM-3AM, what could've been better for a 13 year old guy? LOL! Unfortunately, The USA Network, like many other television stations, has gotten stale, and play many syndicated television shows, which are boring as hell. I will never forget all of the great childhood memories, I received from The USA Network from 1987 until 1993.<br /><br />If there could only be a ""USA Network Classic"" channel created, that could run these old shows, in their original form, including retro USA bumpers. Shows like ""Night Flight"", ""Up All Night"", ""Saturday Nightmares"", and ""Commander USA's Groovy Movies"" that would kick some serious ass!"
29757_0,"A classic in its genre. I remember seeing the ""Emmanuelle"" films (in the days before video or cable TV) at the infamous midnight movies. I just watched it from the DVD in French w/English subtitles. I recommend this format whenever possible on foreign-language films. You can at least hear the actors own voices and the inflections that are often lost with poor dubbing. The acting seemed pretty decent, much better than this sort of film today. Grade: B"
29801_0,"This underappreciated film was one of many great movies from the team of John Ford and Henry Fonda. It is one of the most beautiful and moving films I've ever seen. Fonda plays a Catholic priest in a small Mexican town at a time when Christians were being persecuted by the Government.<br /><br />SPOILERS: He is forced to go on the run and later finds sanctuary, but is tracked down by a man he had come across before. The man tells him about a thief named El Gringo (Ward Bond) who is dying and wants to make a confession. It turns out to be a trick, as the man is a police informant. The police lieutenant who had bragged earlier, ""the last priest was shot 6 months ago"", has a child with a woman that helped Fonda, who baptized the child. He offers to save Fonda if he will renounce his faith, which he will not do. On the way to the firing squad, the man who betrayed Fonda asks for his blessing. The lieutenat is shaken when he hears the gunshot. Soon, a new priest arrives to comfort the crowd of mourners gathered at the church."
29847_0,"I really enjoyed this movie, even better than No, which was also subtle and quirky. The dialogue is flawless. Both Lepage's sibling portrayals are spot on, the cinematography tricks are engaging and perfectly pitched, as is the supporting cast. My only quip is... boy, aren't there any literate Russians in Canada? There are at least two major misspellings, one above the entrance to Tsiolkovsky Institute in (presumably) Moscow (there is no such institution in real life). The other is on the poster at the airport towards the end of the movie. And the Aeroflot announcement on the plane to Moscow sounds just a little bit accented and un-Aeroflotish. Again, this is a great movie and should be widely seen."
29892_0,"I actually own a mix of over 40 old and new martial arts movies. I have also seen recent productions like City of Violence(Korea)and Kill Zone(china)and despite my great exposure to the genre this movie's boldness in comedy, creative and action makes it stand out as the most fully entertaining action movie in a few years. I have seen ong bak, the protector, and born to fight all form the same director and enjoyed all three very much. This movie fits right in; yet still stands out because of the originality, at least in the west, of its story. The main actor was very good and convincing in his fighting. I think the director is the among the best fight action choreographers and photographers in the movie industry second only to matrix legend yuen woo ping and tied with Corey Yuen."
29937_0,"I LOVED this movie for the quiet truthfulness of the characters, the authentic pictures of the countryside and primitive way of life, and the understated humor. Not just women suffered, but any feeling individual was hurt by the Taliban regime. Most will really enjoy the characters, especially the moving mother, who is a female doctor not allowed to practice her craft despite a desperate need for doctors throughout the country. The director avoids all sentimentality, yet the movie has moments of humor, pathos, cynicism, charity and quiet desperation. If you are a woman, you should see this movie. Contains humor, great characters, unbelievable look into the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan, all portrayed with a light touch and great insight."
29982_0,"The majority of critics ADORED this movie and the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, so I figured it was a fairly safe bet. You can't win 'em all. This film was Mumblecore before Mumblecore (a genre which critics initially poured far too much praise upon). Of course, these characters don't mumble as much as simply drone on and on about their fear of eventual failure that would apparently bring more emptiness to their Park Avenue lives. Bringing us into this world has the potential to keep an audience's interest for a short period of time, but the film never progresses behind exploring this youthful angst. It's not a plot issue. A filmmaker can afford to have 90 minutes where not much happens in terms of plot, provided he or she creates characters and situations that are so compelling, you want to continue watching (not much happens in Hal Ashby's ""The Last Detail"" either, but try looking away from Nicolson and company in that film). Alas, that is not the case here. Yet, like Mumblecore (which is thankfully dying a rapid death), this film revolves around post- (or mid-) college, white, upper middle class, awkward youngsters who can't seem to shake their general sense of malaise. The film itself appears to be shot on a shoestring budget, and considering that, the cinematography is quite impressive. However, the acting is often painful to watch (with the exception of Carolyn Farina), and though there are no pyrotechnics, there's barely a plausible moment in the film. None of the characters speak or behave in a way that is even remotely believable. It's one pseudo-intellectual diatribe after another with no hint of a natural segue. The actors all seem to be standing around, with no sense of true life or action, waiting to spew out or be the recipient of the next unmotivated monologue. Aside from a truth-or-dare type party game that involves burning cigarettes through a napkin, there's not one conversation that feels authentic. One scene finds an apparently sober middle-aged man at a local bar pouring his heart out to our pair of 19-year old protagonists for no apparent reason except possibly that the author wanted to squeeze in another monologue. This scene could have worked with a different character if it were more skillfully setup. Finally, the final scene at the beach house is ""groan-worthy"" in its attempt to manufacture misplaced drama, but winds up looking like a bad student film with the poor actors looking completely lost as how to try and make the scene look realistic. However, this was Stillman's first film, so I'd be interested in checking out his other 2 films to see where he went from here."
30025_0,"This is a good film to watch if you like British films from the era and especially ones with Dirk Bogarde. It's made with some style but the script is a problem. Though it starts out intriguingly, in the end this espionage film is rather much ado about nothing. The main point of interest in this rarely seen movie now is the equally rarely heard Jerry Goldsmith score, which I rather like. I believe it got an LP release back in 1968, but has never been issued on CD. Perhaps one of the reasons for that, as I've recently read, is that Goldsmith didn't have a good experience doing the score and never had much to say about it or simply didn't want to discuss it at all. Unfortunate, because the score, though minor Goldsmith, does have merit. I hope someday to read just what Goldsmith's problems were with it."
30070_0,"Critics didn't like this film. Roger Ebert, whose reviews I generally find insightful and on target, gave it just 2 stars and called it ""seriously confused"". On the IMDB hit parade, it only rates about 6 stars. Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous ""Trainspotting"". Then my teenage daughter came home from a party where she and her friends had watched it, and she said, ""It's brilliant! You HAVE to see it, Mum!""<br /><br />So, we rented the video, and I'm glad we did. The Beach is an interesting and solid film that tells an intriguing, if somewhat episodic, story in a stylish way. DiCaprio is, indeed, excellent as a young man searching for life's ultimate experiences, and getting more than he bargained for. This is a loss-of-innocence story, a sort of cross between Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the musical The Fantastics. Director Danny Boyle leads us on Richard's journey to the Heart of Darkness in an energetic, stylish way--filming is interesting and beautiful--and he gets excellent results from his actors. The use of Richard's voice-over as narrative--often a distraction in films--here offers a certain amount of adolescent profundity and acuteness of observation, and it works.<br /><br />I've been a traveller in Thailand. Although Richard's quest and Richard's scene wasn't mine, I've seen it...the beaches, the bars, the snake blood, the dope, the parties. I've also been a high school teacher, and have worked with adolescents hungry to discover ""the real world"", to bite into Eve's apple with gusto. Many from New Zealand head off in their late teens/early twenties on ""The Great OE"" (Overseas Experience). The same is undoubtedly true for many Australians and Brits, if not so commonly for American youth. So there's a strong element of ""truth"" in this story.<br /><br />Don't listen to the critics. This is a good, solid film with an interesting perceptive story, fine performances, and a stylish presentation. Four stars out of five."
30115_0,"This is the most creative, intelligent, well-written, unpredictable, and suspenseful program that I have ever seen, and this is coming from a man who watches a lot of television.<br /><br />Throughout its four seasons, 24 provides a cliff hanger at the end of most episodes to keep you attached and has provided some of the most unpredictable twists that I have ever seen, including the ultimate shocker at the end of the first season (which I won't go into because somebody may read this before watching the first season). <br /><br />As far as acting goes, there isn't a weak-link on the show. Kiefer Sutherland leads a cast of exceptionally impressive and compelling actors/actresses that make the show great week after week.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that if you do not already watch 24, start now because you're really missing out."
30160_0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this film. I knew that it was 4 parts, all thrillers and each somewhat related to the others. I was surprised at how entertaining the movie was. Each part had something in it to make you laugh, groan, roll your eyes and even jump out of your seat. I especially enjoyed The Psychic and it's attention to details (pay close attention to Madam Badeau's shop). <br /><br />The music added to the suspense and terrified the person I was sitting with. The film did need some work with lighting and sound but overall was a fun flick and definitely a thumbs up for people who enjoy this genre."

Yeah the mom sang one song with a woman's voice and the on the next song she was a member of Blackstreet and then back to a woman's voice again... It was funny to see how Generic this was. Another thing, how did the male lead's dad have a mansion and then when they got outside it was a ghetto apartment parking lot. Also, his Spoken Word or shall i say BROKEN WORD was the worst. I guess the best thing about this movie was some of the women. Rent this if you want to laugh and look for mistakes."
30250_0,"Iron Jawed Angels is a true story based on the life of radical suffragists who played a key role in winning the federal constitutional amendment that guaranteed women the right to vote. The film focuses on the years between 1912 and 1920, the last eight in a seventy-two year fight for women to claim the right to vote. Central to the story is Alice Stokes Paul (Hilary Swank,) feminist, suffragist and gifted political strategist, and her co-leader, Lucy Burns (Frances O'Connor.) The story of Paul and Burns, and the group of young, radical women who dedicate their lives to securing women the right to vote is, until now, one of the great-untold American stories of the century. I was moved by the drive of these brave women, inspired by their courage in the face of hatred and cruelty, compelled to join the ranks of these dauntless women whose influence helped give us the right to have a voice in our own government. Iron Jawed Angels is an exceptional film because it tells an important story in a fresh, engaging way. <br /><br />Iron Jawed Angels has all of the elements of the best human drama: loyalty, disagreements, violence, personal sacrifice, and yes, triumph. It faithfully recreates the historical events that led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Constitutional Amendment, such as the memorable 1913 Suffrage Parade that was held during President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, the nonviolent protest at the gates of the White House, arrests on trumped up charges that led to incarceration in a horrific work camp, and the violent force-feedings in response to the imprisoned suffragist's hunger strike. <br /><br />Iron Jawed Angels is a film that delivers a message with well-written story lines, beautiful cinematography and intelligent, witty characterization. The acting in Iron Jawed Angels is superb. Hilary Swank gives a stunning, powerful performance as Alice Paul, the highly educated, brilliant political strategist with a Quaker background and fiery tongue. Frances O'Connor, who holds her ground next to the indomitable Alice, plays her cohort, Lucy Burns, equally well. The beautiful and articulate lawyer, Inez Milholland, played by Julia Ormond, delivers one of the most memorable scenes in the movie when she grandly leads the 1913 parade riding a regal white horse, holding herself with pride and dignity, wearing a resplendent white robe and magnificent angel wings suitably used to symbolize justice and liberty. <br /><br />Anjelica Huston gives a phenomenal performance as the politically conservative, high-powered Carrie Chapman Catt; Huston won the 2004 Golden Globe Award as Best Actress for a Supporting Role in a TV Movie for her role. Catt was the leader of the ""old guard,"" who disliked Paul and Burns' radical notions and methods. Even though the newcomers were initially half-heartedly allowed to participate in the long-standing National American Women's Suffrage Association, eventually they were forced out on their own. They then formed their own political platform, the National Women's Party. One of the triumphs of the film is how Catt rises above her dislike for Paul, wields her political clout and influences the fate of the imprisoned suffragists. As allies, they work together to defeat their opponents and win the right to vote. <br /><br />Contrary to several writers who have criticized the mixture of modern and period music in this film, I enjoyed the musical soundtrack to this film. The majestic sound of the music and striking beats combined with lyrical vocals in Lauryn Hill's ""Everything is Everything"" track perfectly complemented the parade scene. Hill's lyrics uncannily replicate the film's theme; Hill herself is an outspoken advocate working for social justice in our own time; her music and reputation add credibility to the inherent message of the film. <br /><br />I didn't know the remarkable story behind the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment before I viewed ""Iron Jawed Angels."" The determined women who challenged the conventional thinking of the time inspired me. I easily identified with the complex, historical figures of the struggle behind the fight to win women's right to vote; I wanted to join their movement; I wanted to have a part in their crusade. The movie so moved me that I wanted to invite my sister and all of my women friends to share this amazing story with me, so that they, too, could experience the message behind the movie: no matter how entrenched or static a situation is, things can be changed with persistence and will; we really can make a difference. <br /><br />Iron Jawed Angels tells a story that has largely been forgotten, save a few sentences in our high school history books. The story occurs at the birth of a century, the dawn of a new world. And yet, women still did not have the right to vote. Unbelievably, it took women being jailed in conditions that today would be in violation of our civil rights liberties and worldwide United Nations Human Right's Treaties to overcome the unjust laws of the time. These extraordinary women devoted their entire lives to the cause of women's rights. They were beaten up, jailed, insulted, spit on, force-fed through tubes shoved down their throats and noses, and even died, in order to win the right to vote. <br /><br />The voting privilege is distressingly taken for granted by many American citizens today. However, it was not automatically extended to all citizens in our democratic society; it was a right that required a civil war for some and, for women, it required a brave group of iron jawed angels that put their lives on the line and made history. It should not be overlooked that in many other parts of the world it is a right that is still denied; for too many women it remains a distant hope. It is therefore incumbent upon those of us who already enjoy this right to exercise it faithfully. That will be a tribute to the incredible women who fought for the right to vote in America."
30296_0,"One of my personal faves from the early 80`s.This insane tale of teen rebellion and television abuse features an intensely wild and animated performance from Robin Johnson as the juvenile delinquent come rock star Nicky Marauda,and some wickedly understated(for a change)camp from Tim Curry as the enigmatic yet highly opportunistic D.J.Features some great new wave music from XTC,The Ramones,Gary Numan and others set against the backdrop of NYC`s seedier side.Great fun."
30340_0,"When I was looking through the collection at Hollywood Video looking for a rental, I came across He Was a Quiet Man, I'm not sure why, but I picked up the film and just read what it was about. I had never heard of it before, but I enjoy Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, and William H. Macy on screen, they're great actors and then I read on the summary ""Office Space meets Taxi Driver"", lol, I had to see this movie. So I watched it last night, I honestly have to say that I am taken back, this was not only a good movie, but had such knock out performances! Christian Slater, I always liked him in movies, but this performance, I am going to be honest, has to be the best of his career, I barely even recognized him, he was incredible. He makes Bob Maconel, his character, so sympathetic and understandable, that he holds the entire movie so well with class.<br /><br />Bob Maconel is your average working American citizen, unfortunately, he doesn't have the best looks, he lives alone(without the companionship of his talking gold fish), he's taken advantage of at work, and also has a huge crush on a beautiful co-worker, Venessa Parks who would never give him the time of day. Bob has just had it, one day he has a gun and just wants to go crazy in the office and shoot everyone, but guess what? Someone beat him to it, Bob shoots the guy, making him look like a hero, he also sees Venessa on the floor and saves her life, but she unfortunately is paralyzed. They start an interesting relationship, one that could make or break Bob's sanity once and for all.<br /><br />I seriously recommend this movie, it's definitely one of the most interesting films I have seen this year. The way the film was made and edited, at times was a little off, but seriously, it's the awesome performances that really make the film. Christian and Elisha really become their roles and are just incredible together, the scene where Venessa is paralyzed and wants to ""please"" Bob, just his reaction and her tear, the scene was so heart breaking, but touching. You'll have to see what I mean, but trust me, there are many great scenes in He Was A Quiet Man, this is a must see film.<br /><br />9/10"
30386_0,"Alternately brilliant and massively self-indulgent, (three hours? now really, David!). A reasonably straight-forward narrative, (a movie is haunted by the 'ghosts' of a former production of the same tale), is turned inside out, upside down and completely spatially altered by Lynch's unfettered and, you may say, unique imagination.<br /><br />Watching this film is like being allowed access to a very talented and very disturbed artist's psycho-babble. Or maybe it's just a very egotistically talented artist's gigantic joke, (who or what are the giant rabbits?). Whatever, it is still hypnotically watchable which says a lot for Lynch. I can't imagine any other director making this movie, (or any movie like it, not that there might be), and keeping you interested or making you care about the outcome or the fate of the characters, or rather the fate of one character, the actress playing the leading role in the film within the film and whose dream/nightmare most of the film seems to be.<br /><br />For this we have to thank, not only Lynch, but the extraordinary Laura Dern who gives a tour-de-force performance. She's all over the shop but then I suppose that is what acting is all about. Above all, she convinces you that this is serious stuff or at least that she is taking it seriously even if no-one else is. Shot on digital video it is also as much 'about' the process of creating, as opposed to 'making', a film as it is 'about' anything else and in the performances Lynch extracts from his cast, (and not just Dern), you could argue that it is also about the process of acting.<br /><br />It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from ""Twin Peaks"", ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes ""Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it."
30430_0,"The 1982 comedy MY FAVORITE COMEDY was a lovingly made period piece that takes place during a wonderful time in entertainment history...the infancy of live television in the 1950's (or more specifically, YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS). This laugh-filled comic romp follows the adventures of Benji (Mark Linn-Baker), a gopher for COMEDY CALVACADE (this film's version of YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS), who is excited when a swashbuckling actor of the period named Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) has been booked as a guest on the show turns out to be a skirt-chasing alcoholic who Benji is put in charge of keeping under control until showtime. This movie is a lovely valentine to the 1950's with exquisite period detail and an intelligent screenplay that invokes the period so beautifully. O'Toole gives the performance of a lifetime as Swann, an alternately laugh out loud funny and heartbreakingly warm performance that earned him an Oscar nomination, yet somehow Linn-Baker somehow manages to hold his own and never allows O'Toole to blow him off the screen. O' Toole and Linn-Baker get solid support from Lainie Kazan as Benji's mother, Joseph Bologna as King Kaiser, the star of Comedy Calvacade, Cameron Mitchell as a not-too bright gangster, and Adolph Green as the manic producer of the show. A good looking, smartly-written superbly written comedy that documents a long gone era in entertainment history and tells a warm and amusing story as well."
30476_0,"Wow. What can I say? I was truly blown away by this movie. Winner of the Noburo Ofuji award (the most prestigious award in Japan for an animated film), this film has unfortunately only had a very limited release in Japan (although it is playing in theaters again since winning the award). The director, Masaaki Yuasa, has previously done critically acclaimed animation work on other series, and helped create the equally mind-blowing, and somewhat disturbing short animated movie ""Cat Soup"".<br /><br />The first thing about the movie to note is the animation. The animators worked in a collaborative effort, and included a wide range of experimental and traditional animation techniques, a bit of CGI, and even a bit of live action. Viewed as individual pieces, it can be jarring, but seen together as a whole, each piece seems to fit with each other perfectly, with the different animation forms setting the mood perfectly.<br /><br />The story begins in present-day Tokyo, and follows a loser who is letting his childhood girlfriend slip away. Things take a twist to the fantastical side, as the characters embark on a surreal journey that changes everything about them. The actual elements of the plot are not really the focus of the movie..it is about setting the mood, creating the atmosphere of the characters' emotions, and drawing the viewer in to same mental journey the characters are going on, without even realizing it. The pace of the movie picks up and slows in parts, before building up to its thunderous and (literally) exhausting climax.<br /><br />See this movie , if only for the virtuoso animation that you will not see in any other film. And who knows? it just might change your whole outlook on life."
30520_0,"I don't think it is as good as North By Northwest and Rebecca, but Stage Fright was a great film, and this is coming from a Hitchcock fan. The photography is beautiful, and so is the music, making some scenes like the one in the taxi very touching. The script is well crafted, and while you think you know what's happening, the final solution is very unpredictable. My only complaint for the film was the last couple of minutes, the film just ended abruptly without a rounded finish or even a monologue. I liked the story, about a man who is accused of murder and a friend of his sets out to clear his name, it is well told, and doesn't have a sense of contrivance, and I did fear it would do. As for the acting, I had very little problem with it, Jane Wyman was perfectly alluring as Eve. Michael Wilding delights as ""Ordinary Smith"", and while he started off a tad wooden, Richard Todd was fine too. Two of the film's stars impressed me the most though. One was Marlene Dietrich, who was deliciously frosty as the stage actress and singer Mrs Winstead. I find Dietrich quite captivating, with her lovingly designed clothes, beautiful face and distinctive voice, I thought she was a great actress. The other was Alistair Sim, who I consider the best Scrooge ever, with George C. Scott close behind- he had some very funny moments, the most notable one being at the garden party and the doll stall. Even Hitchcock himself has a cameo 30 minutes into the film, as does his daughter Patricia. I didn't know until the end credits, that Kay Walsh, Nancy in Oliver Twist, played the maid. All in all, a very overlooked film, that is actually very clever. It isn't Hitchcock's best, but it is a very good film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
30566_0,"Yami no Matsuei is my all time favorite anime and manga. All the characters are well rounded and fascinating, especially the leads Tsuzuki and Hisoka. Both grew up in painful circumstances but through each other, are able to start healing. Some of the most beautiful and tragic scenes I'd ever witnessed are the ones between Tsuzuki and Hisoka. I actually cried at the end of volume 4 when Hisoka begged Tsuzuki to live for him. It was such a gorgeous moment because I knew without a doubt that these two really do love each other. One of the best villains, in my opinion, appears in this series. Dr. Muraki has to be the coldest and evilest man out there. There are no redeeming qualities about him but he's so fascinating. The connection/bond between Muraki and Hisoka is one of the most intriguing aspects of the show/manga. When Muraki raped and cursed Hisoka, he set upon him a seemingly unbreakable bond between them. Its rather horrifying how the most visually stunning scene in the anime is the rape scene. But what's brilliant about it is that its all done in Muraki's pov. He romanticizes the rape because he is a romantic. He's a sick romantic but nonetheless, he is one. But this is what makes him such a compelling villain. This is a definite must see for those who love great characters, great story lines and beautiful animation."

The Movie got a mainpart which is the crime scene, a sub-part that is the competition at work (who should have the power...), and a sub-part wich contains the daily problems in the family of the main caracter.<br /><br />As a crime movie it has a great story wich really shows how the work of the police and the newspapers really are run! No stupid fictionary roles..."
30656_0,"I have seen this film many times and enjoyed it each time. Although it contains only minimal language concerns, it is best when viewed uncensored and uncut--as are most films. I find the humor that Paul Hogan uses to bring this concept to film takes what sometimes seems familiar story lines and raises them to the wonderfully unique. It has one of those rare mixes of humor, drama, and bittersweet and thought-provoking themes. Hogan provides a consistent character throughout and writes an ending that should be quite satisfying for those who hate the vague, confusing ends so popular with script writers today. Like, Oh God!, I find the movie uplifting with each viewing, as I find Crocodile Dundee's offbeat humor refreshing each time. Regardless of the rating you would give, I am sure you will at least feel the time spent watching this film was worth it."
30700_0,"COMBAT SHOCK is a gritty film about the disillusion and ultimate break down of Frankie, a Vietnam vet, living in New York with his wife and ""child"". Frankie is basically a complete loser with no money, job, or life in general, and the film pretty much just follows him around from one depressing experience to another, until the shocking finale. COMBAT SHOCK is far too bleak for the standard audience, and as a previous reviewer noted, most people either really like, or really loathe this film. Personally, I felt it was a realistic and somber portrayal of an individual who has absolutely nothing positive going on in his life, and no real hope of a better future. If you are clinically depressed or on any type of depression medication, you should probably leave this one alone. Those who prefer more thought-provoking cinema may want to give this one a shot...8/10"
30746_0,"Ken Maynard was a champion horse rider and in his early days worked in rodeos. Not for him the effete air-conditioned acting studio but he learned his acting trade the hard practical way by living the life of a real cowboy. He enjoyed the rough and tumble and hard knocks of cowboy life. He would feel the the pain of dare devil horse riding, eating his meals by camp fire and sleeping under the stars in the cold and hot seasons. Therefore we accept the often improbable story plot elements because we believe the people playing the roles are similar to the those who lived in the real Old West. This is a second tier Ken Maynard movie but we treasure the limited hours of being with Ken as he portrays a real cowboy and a real man . Thank you Ken."
30791_0,"I have not read anyone else's comments on this, so this is my response to having seen a video, purchased cheap. I have for a long time felt a great sympathy (in the sense of fellow feeling) for lesbians, and if these three short dramas did not make all but the most rabid homophobes feel that they were perfectly normal human beings, with the normal human emotions, I don't know what would. The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had ""male"" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well. For me, the acting was uniformly excellent, and I commend everyone involved (some famous names)."
30836_0,"Ah yes, the famous French sense of humour. It's starts with a speed boat going through a shed for no apparent reason at all and then double takes of that. Bebel acts like he is stepping in for the late Louis de Funes- hyperactive, nervous, over the top. The plot reads quite amusing- it's not. Again the whole film degenerates into a farce that has no plot whatsoever and whenever Lautner, normally a competent director, loses the plot completely he adds a car chase which does not make any sense whatsoever. A couple of jibes at Mitterand's government then even try to turn this turkey into a political satire. How funny- the socialist wears a red tie and talks like Lenin on acid. The only good thing about this film is the nubile Sophie Marceau who is frequently fairly naked."
30881_0,"THE DARK TOWER is an obscure movie that had a lot of potential but squandered the whole interesting idea of an evil building due to some really weak acting, a listless script, totally unfocused direction, and a cast that's seemingly above the age of 40! It's always great to see Jenny Agutter in anything but she deserved a better project than this. The direction is truly bizarre. I'm sure the fact that the great Freddie Francis was replaced by another director has contributed to the weirdness of the film but I wonder what they were attempting to do. It's as if they tried to make the building into a character, and at a certain point, they actually succeeded, not because of some great feat of direction but because the human characters are so weak and messed up that the building looked positively sturdy and 3 dimensional compared to them.<br /><br />And speaking of humans, I've never seen such an old looking cast. Yes, Jenny was in her late 30s when she made the movie but because practically everyone is above a certain age, this gave the movie a sorta poky feel to it, which was the last thing THE DARK TOWER needed.<br /><br />But the thing that kills this bizarre quasi-mess is the ending, or the resolution of the mystery/story. It was more funny than scary. One has to see it to believe it.<br /><br />A real curio of a movie worth seeing for fans of bizarre films."
30926_0,"Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me. Overall, I thought the movie was well done. It managed to mix the thriller genre while successfully (to a greater or lesser degree) incorporating both the sci-fi and spiritual elements. Most of it worked. Most.<br /><br />While trying not to give too much away, the plot can be summarized as the story of a widowed father that has resigned himself to the scientific as a result of her death. After a 50 year old time capsule is opened revealing a list of numbers, he begins to notice a patten defining every major catastrophe over the past 50 years. As he follows the pattern, trying to prevent the events to come, he begins to wonder what all of this has to do with him and his son. It is a good thriller and it kept me second guessing myself throughout.<br /><br />I think the hardest part for me with this movie was the special effects. Now, whoever did the graphics certainly did a better job than I could ever do, but as this seemed like a big budget movie and as we've see many movies with similar visual sequences done so smoothly, I was very disappointed and I actually had to try to convince myself to ignore the music video par cgi so I could appreciate the movie. As an example, the fire at the plane scene was very flat and the subway lighting and textures were not believable. Even movies like what pixar has put out have been able to create realistic flowing so the long grass appearing so outdated, again, took away from the believability. Though I will definitely compliment whoever made the object that caused Cage's character to fall to his knees towards the end. THAT was impressive.<br /><br />I think had it not had so many similarities to things such as Signs, or Armageddon, or Die Hard (high tension action), I think it would have gotten a better score.<br /><br />But that said, I would still highly recommend this movie!"
30971_0,"Director Kerrigan has clearly done his homework. It sure looks to me, a person who believes that the Dardenne Brothers (Luc and Jean-Pierre), the French speaking Belgian film makers, are the most interesting filmmakers in the world today, that Kerrigan thinks so, too. He has got down proper the semi-documentary technique that the Belgian Brothers perfected in ""La Promesse,"" ""Rosetta,"" ""Le Fils,"" and ""L'Enfant."" The camera follows the main character solely. We see that person, usually in close-up. The camera will occasionally swing away to show that person's point-of-view or to show who he is talking to, but the camera is mostly on the character's face or looking over the shoulder at where he/she is going. There is no musical soundtrack (even in the opening titles and closing credits) but there is a carefully prepared mix of city sounds and background noises. Luckily, Kerrigan has not just aped a technique, but has also tapped into the same kind of sympathetic, humanistic observation of behavior and optimism about the human race that the Dardennes bring to their stories.<br /><br />William Keane is a part-time street person who suffers from schizophrenia. He haunts Grand Central Station trying to get passers-by to look at a picture of a little girl in a newspaper clipping. ""Have you seen this girl?"" People hurry away. He washes up in rest rooms. He sometimes sleeps outdoors, not noticing the rain. He imagines that kidnap scenarios are going on in the station. He frantically mutters to himself about the growing danger around him. He attacks a bystander, throwing a couple of punches before walking quickly away. Sometimes he has quiet periods when he will use a disability check to buy himself some shelter in a seedy extended stay hotel.<br /><br />Like a certain Academy award winning crowd pleaser from a few years ago, ""Keane"" tackles the question, ""Can a schizophrenic eventually be able to discern his own visions from reality even if he stills sees the visions?"" However, ""Keane"" is about real person, as brought to life by the fine (but largely unrecognized) British actor, Damian Lewis. Anyone who has daily experience with street people can see the truth of Lewis' performance. My Lovely Wife has worked as a nurse's aide in a psych ward of a big city hospital also confirms the truthfulness of Lewis' work. What a marvelous difference from Ron Howard's tear-jerking mush and Russell Crowe's hammy, over-the-top performance of twitches and jerks! ""Keane"" slowly develops a story out of this man's circumstances that brings him to one crucial moment of decision and a powerful resolution in the final second of the film. I absolutely loved ""Keane"" and highly recommend it."
31015_0,"I don't want to tire you all with a long review, there isn't a need for one with this movie. From start to finish it is embarrassing to watch, almost excruciating. Jokes fall flat, send ups of other movies have no comic moments and I seriously could see a 6th grade drama class do a better job of something like this. How this ever got released is beyond me. Why Alyson Hannigan decided to star in this movie is beyond me. Sophie Monk was the only decent actor and put on the American accent well in her first movie role (despite being cast as eye candy for the male audience). The remainder of the cast whilst possibly talented had so little to work with they would fire their agents if they ever see this trash. I saw this movie because it was free (like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session). No one was laughing and I am sure I could hear tumbleweeds rolling through the cinema at various times. In all I counted about 4 scenes which made me laugh, I won't spoil them for you so that if you do happen to get dragged to this flick you will have some comic relief. My advice is to stay clear, well clear. Scary Movie 2 was better than this."
31060_0,"We've all seen this type of movie a million times and yet we keep paying to see it again and again. Guy gets his heart broken at a young age, becomes a player, has one night stands until one day he somehow manages to woo the 'one that got away' and they live happily ever after. If I have to sit through one more of these terrible uninspired chick flicks, I just might throw my TV out the window. <br /><br />Matthew McConaughey was his usual laid back, douche bag self and Jennifer Garner could have been played by any number of horse-faced actresses just as well (Sarah Jessica Parker, perhaps?). The only one worth mentioning was Michael Douglas as the sleaze-bag uncle. He brought the only two laughs that I emitted during the whole film. If it weren't for his character, I would have given the movie 0/10 instead of 2/10. <br /><br />I would only recommend this movie to females that are afraid to think for the duration of 90 minutes at a time."
31105_0,"The first time I saw this I caught the last 15 minutes and that (combined with a great song by Bjork/David Arnold) convinced me I had to see it again. Mostly new faces or ""isn't that..err whatsisname?"" faces and all combine to make a great movie. The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard and although Harvey Keitel is an ""adviser"", he still gets the chance to show that he is one of Hollywood's tough characters. Viggo Mortensen is thoroughly evil and good at it. Keith Allen is (with more hair) just as nasty - as are the teeth of his sidekick Byrne - and continues to be a character you just cannot like. All in all, another great of British cinema."
31150_0,"I must say I wasn't expecting much from this when I bought the DVD, but ended up having an absolute blast. Matthew Nelson gives a surprisingly sympathetic performance. I found myself feeling so sorry for the character, and wanted things to work out for him and his love interest. Suffice it to say he finally slips all the way into madness, and seeks bloody retribution on his numerous tormentors. The best moments in this film come from Nelson really showing the characters pain. Nothing goes right for him, and literally every single person in his life is abusive to him in one way or the other. The dark humor here is hilarious, although some may find the side characters who torture Monty, to be way over the top. Still that makes all the more amusing when the movie goes all out slasher in the final 20 minutes or so. One negative a couple kills showed the films' low budget. Most of it is actually quite effective, but the sprinkler scene for example doesn't quite work. Still Delivery caught me off guard, and entertained the hell out of me. Definitely check this one out."

31240_0,"I gave this movie a 10 rating, not because it was that good of a film (it wasn't), but because to me it brings back memories of my teenage years. I saw this movie when it was released in 1951. I was 15 at the time and interested in nothing but golf. I watched the movie three times. I would have watched it over and over had it not been removed from the local theater. Even at that young age, I was a student of the game. I was intimately familiar with Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, and all the other great names in golf at that time. I had even seen most of them play in person in tournaments. I even fantasized about becoming a golf pro. I played golf whenever I could. Unfortunately, in the 40's and 50's, money was tight. And parents didn't pay a lot of attention to their children's career goals, especially if they involved becoming a sport's figure. My dreams were dashed early. Thank goodness, I can still watch FOLLOW THE SUN and relive my teenage fantasies."
31286_0,"This film was included in THE ANIMATION SHOW VOLUME THREE--a compilation of short films arranged by Don Hertzfeldt and Mike Judge. Overall, this is a very impressive DVD--and much of it is due to CITY PARADISE.<br /><br />The plot of CITY PARADISE is pretty much indescribable, as it's very surreal and will make your head explode if you think too much. The animation style is pretty exciting--with a combination of live action and animation. In many scenes, the faces are digitized human faces applied to spider-like drawings--though many of the minor characters are simply animated. The backgrounds, like the people, are also a combination of digital images and animation.<br /><br />The story, from what I am able to describe, is about a Japanese woman who comes to London. However, once there it just gets weirder and weirder but you also find yourself transfixed because of the unusual story and animation. More an artistic work than a cartoon."

NCIS (originally titled Navy NCIS) appeared as a spin off of one of the shows in JAG's final season. I love NCIS because it is a very ""figure it out"" show with out all the blood and gore of CSI. Plus, I love almost anything present day military, so NCIS is right up my alley. The biggest thing that won me over with NCIS was, like JAG, the show isn't driven by the things that happen to the characters but more about how they handle the issues and relate to each other to solve the problems. If you liked JAG, NCIS may become your new favorite show, too."
31376_0,"I'm reviewing this movie for the 2nd. time. After many years, I caught this movie on Mexican cable and I'm glad that I liked it better than the first time I watched it. As a kid, I hated this movie because it trashed my favorite slasher characters, Freddy and Jason.<br /><br />Anywways, this is a Mexican version of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" part 1 and II and has some elements from the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels. Also, some little influences by ""The Evil Dead"". <br /><br />The story follows Michael and his friends, who after Michael's birthday party decide to play with the ouija board. Unfortunately to them, an evil spirit named Virgil possesses one of them and starts a killing spree taking revenge on everyone who played with the board. Virgil makes a late appearance in the movie but manages to dispatch his victims one by one... until only Alex and Michael are left. <br /><br />Could Michael stop Virgil? How is he going to use the ""magic"" dagger against him? (In the style of ""Jason Goes To Hell""). Could it be that Virgil is really more dangerous than Freddy and Jason? Watch ""Don't Panic"" with low expectations and you might surprise yourself.<br /><br />The movie is very cheesy, but not in a negative way. It's cheesy in an 80's manner! We get plenty of gore, some nasty death scenes, a ""cool"" score (I love the ""Don't Panic!"" song), and some creepy scenes. RYes, the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" influenecs are present through all the movie. Especially from Part II: Freddy's Revenge. Michael's character is very similar to Jesse. He even has a friend who is killed in front of him and can't do anything but escape from some stupid cops. Also, Michael has this wimpy attitude but manages to confront Virgil and beware all of his friends. <br /><br />The movie has this 80's feeling that we all love. This is the typical slasher flick from the 80's that spent more budget on the visuals. The f/x are cheesy but worked for me. The gore is great! (Check out a death scene similar from Dario Argento's ""Opera""). <br /><br />The acting is way all over the top but still works for this kind of movie. Bishof delivers a good performance, Gaby Hassle delivers a cute, solid performance. She's way too pretty to be around all the gore. Virgil is a mix of looks; he has the looks of possessed Ash from ""Evil Dead II"", but the make-up of his face is almost the same as Freddy Krueger! Although he isn't as annoying as Freddy. He just keeps repeating ""Do You believe in Satan?!"". But it isn't as annoying as Krueger's one liners. His demise is very gory and great. Lots of blood through his mouth! <br /><br />One of the cheesiest scenes in slasher history is when Michael goes to Alex's house, becomes mad, and starts shooting! Horrible acting in that scene by the way. I liked the ending which is very ""moving"" and has an extremely cheesy line that references one love scene: ""As long as love exists between you two the rose shall never wither."". The scene happens when Alex is in the graveyard...<br /><br />This movie took the right influences and ripped them off in almost a cynical way but still this movie is cheese for the please. Watch it if you can find it, although it will be very hard , as far as I know, it's currently out of print. Or maybe you can find it with the title ""Dimensiones Ocultas"". ""Don't Panic"" is a pleasant surprise and deserves a chance. Probably one of Mèxico's best Horror/Fantasy movies. Yes, this is quality here but still is entertaining!"
31420_0,"** out of ****<br /><br />I watched this knowing what it was going to be like. I knew it would be trashy, cheap, unassuming, and interesting. But unfortunately, this film is none of these things. I went in expecting these things and i had them all shoved back into my face. I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as KALIFORNIA, but i was taken agog when i discovered what it really was.<br /><br />The film is basically just about a couple who hook u with a young outlaw and basically go on a trip to nowhere. While on this trip, they have some encounters with several people who they end up murdering. They don't show any kind of guilt by doing this. Just regret.<br /><br />This film was too easy. It's concluding statement is that the youth of today have made their world there own personal hell. This is established from the beginning and then the film decides to show as many different ways of showing this as it can. For me it didn't work, but in a strange way, it did. I liked the way the film doesn't take or give any sort of apologies for the weird images it shows. I liked the way the film showed us a continuing spiral around repetition. I usually hate it when a film does these sorts of things, but here it fit perfect. Rose Mcgowen does a fine job in her role of what appears to be a girl with terrets syndrome.<br /><br />The major problem is that the film just doesn't show enough of... well... everything. The scenes are half heartedly done, the characters are half heartedly developed, and the set design just seems to keep repeating more and more strange set tone and color, but not enough variety. Take, for instance, a surreal scene in which the teenagers accidentally hit a dog on the road and put it out of its misery. What makes this scene funny is the fact that they have already murdered several people throughout the course of the film, and yet when they hit the dog, they show more genuine emotion for hitting this animal than for murdering another human being. And yet the viewer will still get the feeling that they didn't show enough emotion for the dog either. There must be something wrong with a film when the only scene in the film where the viewer can feel anything relative to the characters in a regular human being is in a particular scene right at the very end which involves hedge trimmers and Nazis. Obviously, it is scenes like the one with the dog that drive the message of the film home.<br /><br />Now, the main problem with the film is how director Greg Araki(Mysterious Skin, Totally F*ckd Up) has to add a little zing to the carnage scenes. He adds style, which should definitely not be used in a film like this. There is a scene where a store owner's head is blown off with a shotgun, right off the stump. Now this scene is pretty straight forwardly done. Two people struggle with the gun, it goes off, someone is killed in the process. The thing is, once the the head lands in the guacamole, it screams and lurches, as if still alive. Now there's nothing wrong with having something like this in a film of this texture. The problem arises when it is talked about on local news programs that begin the discussion of how the head was sworn to be talking at the scene of the crime, and how a necklace was found at the scene of the crime along wit several other dead bodies. This is the kind of stuff that isn't necessary and certainly doesn't make the film any more interesting. It makes the film slow paced. And for a film that is less than 90 minutes, that is something that a director, especially one like Greg Araki, who has made some amazing films, should definitely avoid doing. Just look at films like KIDS or BULLY. They don't fall into the trap of being stylized for the sake of being stylized.<br /><br />Homosexuality also is a frequent concept that is brought up several times in the film. Now i have absolutely nothing against homosexuality in films. I don't even care if it's just a casual occurrence in a film.But in this film, the concept of the boyfriend being gay, or the drifter being gay is simply something that isn't explored to any real extent. In fact, the aspect of Rose Mcgowen or her boyfriend being a straight couple is barely explored either. For a film that has so much gay sex, straight sex, and three ways, there really should be more of an attempt for sexual exploration of the characters and less of a chore. I know that it is just a thing that these characters do, and i know that they don't care who loves who or what they want to do with each other, but they could have at least had an orgy and not just a series of weird encounters.<br /><br />Having said that, i do find the film interesting in its own trashy way. And i do kind of think the film is worth seeing, but the whole awkwardness of what the film attempts and repeatedly succeeds to prove is dumbed down by its finishing touches.<br /><br />(the film is not rated but is intended to be viewed by adults only. it contains overdone violence and gory images, a substantial use of strong language, lots of graphic sex and nudity, and a fair share of drug use.)"
31466_0,"Having seen at least a couple dozen Bergman films, this biographical movie made a lot more sense to me than if I hadn't. I could see bits and pieces of his other films, particularly parallels with Fanny and Alexander. This movie was written by but not directed by Ingmar Bergman and tells about a portion of his father and mother's lives (with particular focus on the father). However, unlike the cruel and over-zealous preacher from Fanny and Alexander, Bergman's father is a flawed man full of dichotomies. A very pious and severe man with little sense of humor, he also apparently has no problem with premarital sex (with two different women) and is an advocate for the working poor. I think these inconsistencies and his father's difficulty with expressing normal human emotions lead to Bergman's earlier works (such as the professor in Wild Strawberries and the persistent theme of living in the barren wilds in movies such as The Passion of Anna and Shame).<br /><br />So, why didn't I score the movie higher? Well despite the insights, the movie was very long and occasionally tedious--particularly for the Bergman novices. Plus, although the movie gave us some insights, the actual span of time covered in the film was rather limited. It was like a glimpse but an incomplete glimpse of the man."
31510_0,"To sum up the plot of Jaguar Lives! in a couple of sentences  Jaguar is a secret agent with a mission that takes him around the world to locate and bust-up up a large-scale heroin ring. If along the way he's able to find out who killed his former partner, so much the better. Joe Lewis (1979 World Karate Champion) is Jaguar. While his acting may be a bit stiff, his moves certainly aren't. The man knows how to throw a kick. He's joined by one of the most amazing casts for a nothing movie like this that I've ever seen  Christopher Lee, Donald Pleasence, Barbara Bach, Woody Strode, Joseph Wiserman, John Huston, and Capucine all lend their varied talents to the film. None has very much to do or much screen time, but Pleasence makes the most of his role as a South American dictator. Unfortunately, none of these actors is able to save Jaguar Lives! from mediocrity. The plot is pretty much a muddled mess, relying on set-pieces featuring fights to move the plot along. The big reveal of the head bad guy at the end of the movie shouldn't surprise anyone who's been paying the slightest bit of attention. And Lewis just doesn't have what it takes to hold the movie together.<br /><br />So, while I'm impressed with the supporting cast and the money spent shooting in exotic locations around the world, Jaguar Lives! just isn't all that good. With all that being said, I'm a bit shocked to see that Joe Lewis didn't many more movies. Sure, his acting may have been lacking, but people with similar acting ability but with only half of Lewis' martial arts ability were churning out movies in the 80s."
31556_0,Mark Sobel's The Commission provides an insightful look into a period of US history around which many doubts and shadows have been cast. His interpretation of how events unfolded around the Warren Commission is worth seeing. He does a remarkable job using primary source material to comprise nearly 100% of the film. There is significant historical value in Sobel's approach for anyone interested generally in US history or specifically in the JFK assassination. The impact of watching actual real-time footage combined with Sobel's rendering of the Warren Commission's inner-workings is compelling. It will perhaps encourage viewers to consider whether the US system of appointing commissions to study important events is the best and most valid approach to answering difficult questions.
31600_0,"Stranded premiered on Lifetime last night. Erica Durance stars as Carina, a bride-to-be on a bachelorette vacation in the Caribbean just before her wedding. Her friends Regan (outstanding performance by Bree De Beau), Nicole (Michelle Jones), Isabel (Vane Millon) and another pretty girl accompany her for what is supposed to be a fun-filled week. The girls decide to travel to a smaller island for a day trip, but their boat does not return to pick them up as scheduled and they find themselves stranded on a deserted island. Unfortunately for the girls, this is just the beginning of what is certain to be a nightmare. Talented Ashley Totin also stars as Danielle, Carina's best friend and maid of honor. Carlos Ponce and sexy Jack Hartnett also stars. The actor in the role of Danielle's boss does a nice job (and is also very good looking). <br /><br />I enjoyed this movie so much. Total suspense for nearly the entire movie and a couple of twists to make it all the more better. All characters were beautiful, dressed well, and played their parts convincingly. Director Kern Knoweiser does an excellent job here. The Caribbean locations were stunning."
31646_0,"This title can best be described as a '' Pay it forward '' on the Philipines. Without the glitter and the glamor of a Hollywood flick, it tells the heartwarming story of a young boy from a poor family, trying to arrange the burial for his grandmother. Of course he teaches the so called adults around him that they have to break their lethargy around certain choices to get further in life.<br /><br />I had to get used to the simplistic way of filming. It felt a bit cheap, comparing to most of the similar films made in the U.S. But as the story evolved, I also started to like this simplicity because of the authentic view it gives us of poverty in the Philipines. It never felt artificial, as most of the American movies with similar themes usually do. Its characters are humans of flesh and blood, and although their acting is stiff and sometimes uncharismatic, they feel natural. <br /><br />But still, at the end I felt a bit hollow. This usually happens when I liked a movie but when there is some aspect that doesn't really fulfill my expectations. The ending is cheesy, predictable and far from original. It doesn't surpass the level of those cheap '' based on true stories ''- movies or anything inspired by the books of Danielle Steel. And to add more criticism; the soundtrack is incredible awful.<br /><br />My conclusion: At the end it's not that great, but that doesn't mean that I couldn't like this cute story. Especially the scene in which our little hero measures up the size of his grandmother is truly heartwarming. This is for the sensitive moviegoers, cynics shouldn't even bother to try it!"
31691_0,"This movie has a wonderful quality that would bring any distant family together. My children and I loved watching it together. It's nice to have a movie finally come out that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend seeing it. Emma Thompson is so endearing. Colin Firth is such a lost soul trying to avoid everything and everyone around him. Angela Landsbury is so over the top, but very funny. Together they make such an interesting trio. The love, the comedy, the magic, and the unbelievable happy ending make it more than just a fairy tale, they make it a story that makes you wish that it was all happening to you. For children, it sets their minds imaginations into over-drive. It sends them to a place that lets their minds run free to believe in everything on the big screen in front of them. For just an adult, I would say, it would be less special, as apposed to an adult who has children to watch get engaged with this magical movie."
31736_0,"The lives of peasants living in a remote Mexico village are examined in this marvelous film by director Francisco Vargas. The situation parallels, in a way, the conflict in that country that has been in the news for a few years.<br /><br />As the film opens one can see a prisoner being tortured by a soldier. The scene changes to a bucolic setting in which an old man, his son, and grandson are seen boarding a makeshift truck transporting them to a nearby town. The older man, Plutarco, is a violinist and his son, Genaro, plays the guitar. They play for patrons at a restaurant for tips which the grandson, Lucio collects. With their meager earnings they get to eat. One thing is established, Genaro is part of the rebels that are fighting in the mountains nearby.<br /><br />The story changes quite drastically as the men go back to their village. There are soldiers everywhere setting their town on fire. Genaro, who is involved with the rebels flees to a safer place, leaving the older man and his son to fend for themselves. Plutarco wants to help his son but because he must travel through the soldier's camp in order to go to his small piece of land, he becomes the object of curiosity as the fiddler who becomes a figure of amusement for the commander of the troop. Plutarco's violin will become key to the story, as is his relationship with the top army man will be put to a test. Plutarco and Genaro will be together at the end. These men, like most of their friends and neighbors seem doomed because the unfair way life dealt with them.<br /><br />""El violin"" is an unique film in which poverty and necessity have made the peasants take things into their own hands trying to get rid of the oppressing and ruthless soldiers that keep them down. It seems that the poor men one sees are part of people that are kept in poverty throughout different generations. The peasants get our admiration for being noble and having to put up with conditions no human being should have to face.<br /><br />The acting is excellent in general. Best of all, Angel Tavira, who is seen as the proud and stoic Plutarco. One can see in this man's eyes a distinct hatred for the men that keep him down, yet, he makes a fatal mistake that will prove fatal. Gerardo Taracena has some good moments as Genaro and Gilberto Palacios appears as the commander.<br /><br />One of the best achievements in the film is the crisp black and white cinematography of Martin Boege and Oscar Hijuelos. This is a major triumph for Francisco Vargas who has created a satisfying story about the oppressed people from Mexico."
31781_0,"I went into this movie with a friend thinking it would be a cheesy, fun horror movie - just a good way to pass the time on a rainy day.<br /><br />Oh god, was I wrong.<br /><br />It's as if the director spent the film's entire budget acquiring Lindsay Lohan and disregarded everything else. EVERYTHING within this film is bad - the scary parts aren't scary (or even remotely suspenseful), the dialogue is awful, the acting is questionable at best, and, I am very sorry to say that Lindsay Lohan's stripping/ sex scenes were not sexy at all. On top of everything else, the killer was obvious and the plot didn't even make a whole lot of sense. Even the quality of film used is inferior to the type normally used (yes, you can tell).<br /><br />Some films are so bad they're good. This film was just SO BAD.<br /><br />Don't wait for the DVD. Just don't watch it."

31961_0,"This must be one of the best movies ever made. Boorman shows with this movie what a great director he is, and I can't wait to see his new movie with Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voigt. Boorman has an excelent eye for how to make art-work of a movie and Excalibur is no exception. He has put together some not-so-famous actors, and yet he managed to make them more trustworthy than most of the more famous actors. It is just sad that it doesn't seem to be Boorman who will be making the saga ""Lord of the Rings"" into an epic movie. My recommendation to all is: watch this movie and forget about the newly shot mini-tele movie with Sam Neill."
32005_0,"This movie will really give you better understanding of such terms as ""purposeless"" and ""pointless"". It's simply a series of episodes, which never add up to anything. The only thing one can recommend about this familiar drama (which still doesn't make it worthwhile) is the solid acting: Barkin's performance stands out."
32050_0,"I must say I was not expecting to like this movie but I did. My husband buys low budget films all the time and I don't like them. I was busy on my pc and halfway through the movie became drawn into it. The end was the best, it actually struck a cord with me. No other film has spoken to me in this way. It has helped me to feel comfortable in my space of being an educated-accomplished-determined at-home-mom. My biggest critique is that the film does seem incredibly slow at moments, and some of the actors were not good. Boris was great of course! Overall its soo worth sitting through for all you educated broke entrepreneur spirit filled moms out there waiting for your big break and not existing fully in the moment. Good soundtrack. Yellow Teeth. People with an older baby that can't change a diaper. Close shots. Great story. Real people. Excellent message."
32096_0,"I had read a number of negative reviews before renting this movie. I, too, had wondered why a movie with stars like these had not stayed in theaters for more than a blink. With all of that in mind, I sat down with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Liam Neesom plays an undercover cop with a failing digestive system after coming too close to death following his last assignment. He plays the part only moderately well, certainly not as well as would be expected when compared to some of his better movies, but nothing to complain about. Oliver Platt was wonderful; he played a loser killer, hopelessly desperate and hating himself. He was a mediocre bad guy, but he was supposed to be a mediocre bad guy. His posing ""mean"" expressions were hilarious and well matched for his character.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot. It has funny lines (such as Neeson describing the dirty details of his job to a mostly yuppie support group), and some visual humor. The plot is tight, but I will say that the love interest (Sandra Bullock, who he meets when he visits for an enema) could have been completely taken out of the movie and it would not have lost anything. She felt like almost an afterthought for how much she contributed to the development of the movie.<br /><br />The ending threw me off as being very far-fetched, but Hollywood will do that in order to get a ""happily ever after"" ending. It tied up the loose ends well but was just a little too hard to believe.<br /><br />Had I watched it in theaters, I might have been disappointed. Since I would have otherwise just played on the Internet, I enjoyed myself while watching this. I thought it was fun, and I'd recommend it to others."
32140_0,"This is a real gem of a movie from the early 80s. The script which is very funny and witty, expertly oscillates between comedy and tragedy. It reminds me of many great John Irving novels. Conti's performance as Gowan McGland, a washed up Scottish poet, is at the heart of this film. Conti's portrayal is so good that I can't think of anyone else doing it. We're charmed by this tragic and comic figure. Kelly McGillis also gives a good performance as the college student who gets mixed up with the world-renowned poet. The relationship is realistic and adult - they both know it will end. What they don't know is the shocking way in which it does end. It's a highly entertaining, thought-provoking and powerful classic. It's mind-boggling that it isn't available on DVD."
32186_0,"You can find my review for the 1959 version by clicking on my name.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the Douglas Sirk remake of Imitation of Life (1959). It was the third film from that director I saw, and I felt that he was trying to play it straight, make a prestige picture, denying the insanity of classics such as Written on the Wind. Seeing the 1934 version of this film, I only find my opinion of the 1959 version reinforced. Sirk barely changed anything. He doesn't crank it up a notch. He changes the main white character's profession (Claudette Colbert, 1934, and Lana Turner, 1959). In the older version, she (with the help of her black maid (Louise Beavers, 1934, Juanita Moore, 1959)), establishes a pancake restaurant. One day, a customer (character actor Ned Sparks) suggests that they start selling the pancake mix in boxes, which will (and does) make them rich. In the 1959 version, Lana Turner, as I remember, is an actress of some sort. I suppose I prefer the pancake story better, because I get sick of seeing pretty women become successful actresses in movies. Weighing the two films against each other, they do come out pretty even. For example, the conflict of the young, light-skinned black girl (played by Fredi Washington in 1934, Susan Kohner in 1959) is much more fleshed out in the later version, and it just works better. Kohner is a better actress than Washington, as well. The main white character's daughter (Rochelle Hudson in 1934, Sandra Dee in 1959) works better in the earlier version, as Hudson is a better actress than Dee. Louise Beavers and Juanita Moore come out as a dead heat. They're equal. Too bad neither of them are that good. I suppose the original novel must be to blame for this; the black maid character is very poorly developed in both films (so I assume it was the same in the novel), and, in the end, they both lack focus. I suppose it comes down to the last race, Lana Turner and Claudette Colbert. Well, now here, in the films' main characters, we find a clear winner. Personally, I just don't like Lana Turner. I thought she was poor in Imitation of Life (it's the only film I've seen with her, and it makes me want to avoid others). On the other hand, Claudette Colbert doesn't have a great track record with me. However, I really thought she was great in Imitation of Life. She's utterly charming, clever, and gorgeous. Blondes are overrated anyhow. I much prefer Ms. Colbert's doe eyes. 1934 was really Colbert's year, with this, Cleopatra, and her Oscar-winning role in It Happened One Night (which I'll watch in the next couple of days, incidentally). So 1934 Imitation of Life ends up winning by a nose. Neither film is great, mind you, but both are worthwhile. 7/10."

32366_0,"I am a huge John Cena fan, so I'm not writing this just to pick on him.

BOOM! Run, John, run. See John drive. See John swim. Swim, swim, Boom! Run, swim, hit, BOOM, hit, hit, kiss - The end.<br /><br />The long version: I'll skip the cheesy opening credits and the bizarre soundtrack (which at more than one point seems to be channeling Celine Dion). The movie was supposedly directed by one John Bonito; I wouldn't say that the movie was directed so much as it wandered along aimlessly, occasionally bumping into scenery. Even the scenery refused to ""act"" (Queensland, Australia is NOT South Carolina, Mr. Bonito). Mr. Cena ambles along through the famous jungles of ""South Carolina,"" occasionally stopping to glance around, never conveying the slightest hint that he might actually be thinking something. Five minutes into the movie, I apologized to the friend I dragged along with me to see it. Ten minutes into it, I officially began imagining a completely different movie. By the end, I no longer cared who lived. I wouldn't have minded if the characters had simply begun shooting themselves, just so that we'd all be put out of our misery.<br /><br />I wanted this to be a fun movie - I like a fun, cheesy action film as much as the next person - but this movie didn't even try.

In addition, her mom's continuously on the charity circuit, so she's never around for those heart-to-heart talks that young women need. So, left to her own devices, she has a gang of other females in need of thrills who rob gas stations and rape young men.<br /><br />While this tragedy is at times overly done, the point is still well made that parents need to be involved in their children's lives. Sterno says give The Violent Years some time from your life.<br /><br />"
32500_0,"This 85-minute film was intriguing for the first half hour. Then it begins to bog down, big- time. After an hour, it was like pulling teeth for me to finish the last third of the movie.<br /><br />Olivia de Havilland plays identical twins, one of whom commits a murder. Most of the film is devoted to psychiatrist who tries to figure out which of the two women is the guilty party. Both twins have an alibi for the crime. That sounds better than it played.<br /><br />Lew Ayers plays the shrink, ""Dr. Scott Elliott."" Thomas Mitchell plays the investigating police officer, ""Lt. Stevenson."" (They never said his first name.) With a fine director like Robert Siodmak, I expected a better movie but then again, all of the Freudian nonsense usually turns me off. Also, the story was too much of a stretch. Sorry to waste Olivia's talents in this psycho-babble yawner."
32546_0,"I usually give all movies a fair chance, but in this case, I'll make an exception. The movie was filmed in a classic way which was not very impressive. The acting was extremely sub-par, and the lines given to the actors were not much to work with. Most of the scenes in this movie were extremely cheesy and predictable. It seemed to me like the actors were brought out of a closet that they have been stuck in since the 80's Some of the themes of the movie were not approached like they should have been. A boy who seem to have a mental condition is made fun of throughout the whole movie, and hardly anybody did anything to try and help him with his problems. I have not seen the other Sleepaway Camp movies, but was thoroughly unimpressed by this one."
32591_0,"This is a good example of a interesting idea horribly executed.<br /><br />The only positive thing i can say about this film is that Mauro Lannini gives a credible performance as the unbalanced DeSalvo. This, however, can not save this low-budget effort.<br /><br />The sparse sets are mostly dreadful - there is no period detail whatsoever and therefore very little atmosphere. Apart from Lannini, the quality of acting is mediocre and the script itself is uninspired and instantly forgettable.<br /><br />The director relies too heavily on ""flashback"" sequences giving the film a disjointed feel and the numerous overhead shots of Boston in-between scenes soon got on my nerves.<br /><br />On a lighter note, the film concludes with one of the most amusingly awful ""aging"" effects i've ever seen as Jason David wears a tonne of make-up to portray an old detective Riley.<br /><br />Overall - definitely one to miss."
32636_0,"Jeff Goldblum plays a Jewish clown who survives the Holocaust by pretending to be Nazi officer Willem Dafoe's dog. Sounds like a tasteless, cheesy Italian movie from the '70s, right? Oh, if only. This cringe-worthy material could have been magic, an easy-made cult classic. Unfortunately, Paul Schraeder directs. I'm sure he's directed a few good films. I've seen one or two okay ones. But he's so boring. He's so literal-minded and unambitious. Adam Resurrected is a first rate bore. Goldblum and Dafoe try to make it ""fun"", but Schraeder's only interested in making a dire Holocaust picture. We just don't need another one of those. For the record, the Holocaust plot line is really only the flashback sequences. The present-day sequences (set in 1960s Tel Aviv) have Goldblum in a mental hospital, complete with the ultra-lame mental hospital clichés (one woman thinks she's holding up the sky from falling - how wonderful!). He is ""resurrected"" when he finds a young boy who was raised as a dog and he attempts to cure him."

When the ninja kids do their moves, they do not look realistic and they do not actually hit the targets when they do the moves, but the bad guys get hit anyway. Also, to hold off the criminals in their home, the ninjas give two of them diarrhea?? How lame is that? DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! IT STINKS!!!

The reviews here in the UK were quite favourable, which makes me think that there was an exchange of brown envelopes off-screen as well as on-screen. Oh, and the subtitles were some of the worst I've seen, particularly in all the business-related discussions (Eigenkapital equity translated as ""Personal Capital"", Abschreibungen as ""Deductions"" etc.). Seeing as the whole plot revolves around these bits, you'd have thought they'd get someone to proof-read it who is familiar with these sort of terms."

The acting was average at best; most of the performances were either cliche or stilted. The characters themselves were, to a person, unlikeable; I didn't care what happened to them. The movie limped along to its uninspired climax. (No pun intended, I assure you.) The word must have gone out: Give this movie good reviews; it's a lesbian flick."
32816_0,"i found the plot synopsis for this movie pretty interesting and for sure the basic ideas could have been easily transformed into an excellent movie, so i found it very promising to check out this flick. usually i try to stay neutral and don't get my hopes too high upfront and would for sure have been satisfied with an at least mediocre thrill ride.<br /><br />it all starts with our main protagonist captured and been held captivated by a group of people that claim that he is a guest and is about to change. to archive that they want to take away what means the most to him. as soon as he gets tortured for the first time and they take his sense of taste away the viewer instantly knows what that is: his senses. since there aren't too many of those we it becomes clear very early in the movie what will happen within the next 90 minutes. as a movie buff it always worries me when they reveal most of the next events so early in a movie. there are very few directors to either manage to dig themselves outta that hole use that to their advance. Hitchcock would be one of those rare examples that even used this as a stylistic element. unfortunately we don't see such brilliance here.<br /><br />we further get explained that his sufferings are being broad casted. by that they can only mean an internet stream as TV would be way too off. people can contribute money, write letters and vote his sufferings to stop. the main goal according to the kidnappers is to get together money for their operations.<br /><br />our protagonist also gets some time with a seemingly innocent female that claims that she doesn't support the ways of the group she's in. this might have been believable in 1960 when this genre wasn't as overused as it uses to be, but nowadays this is simply not plausible.<br /><br />to justify that exactly this guy has been picked for the operation we see some flashbacks and some explanations by the protagonist himself into the camera, showing that he has been a ruthless idiot without morals in his life. not, necessarily evil, but just not a good guy. i have no idea why that should be a justification for keeping him captivated, torture him for weeks and then cripple him for life, but alright.<br /><br />all of this counted together makes what we see completely random. the main character is not sympathetic and not evil. the evildoers are simply villains without a reasonable justification. after 45 minutes it just gets mighty boring as it is completely random and pointless. as the graphic violence shown has no real meaning but to shock and disgust the viewer it gets extremely boring. i don't enjoy watching someone getting tortured for 90 minutes. there is no thrill in that, it's just stupid.<br /><br />nevertheless i was hoping for a clever conclusion AND twist at the end to make up for my lost time. disappointingly this doesn't happen and the movie simply ends.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i am a horror movie fan, but this is not a horror movie. there is no thrill in it. i enjoy getting scared and i have seen quite a few Japanese extreme horror movies, but without justification there is no thrill. if this would have been an action movie it would have been transfered to this: i guy drives around in a car and just kicks the heck out of random people and shoots some other, without no reason or background story behind it.<br /><br />also this genre of movie is not new. if it were there would at least been the justification of going beyond everything else that has been done in other movies just to prove a point. i know for a fact that this has been done much more extreme to prove those points. if you take a look at the guinea pig series then even in the genre of wannabe-snuff-movies this example is just a very lame attempt to even reach those limits.<br /><br />overall this has been a very disappointing experience."

32906_0,"The Empress Elizabeth II rules mid-eighteenth century Russia. She marries her heir, the physically impotent German prince Peter, to the German princess, Catherine (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Catherine takes a lover, bears a child, plots against her husband and deposes him after he has reigned only six months. She becomes the Empress Catherine II. Well-educated and with liberal ideas, she is an astute politician and wages war with success. Yet when rebellion confronts her with the choice between fostering freedom and suppressing rebellion, she chooses suppression.<br /><br />Catherine II was a fascinating and complex ruler, the period was crucial in determining the future course of Russia, its expansionary empire, its reactionary society and primitive economy. This film, however, addresses none of these great themes, except in the most cursory and superficial manner. It is a shallow drama of empty spectacle, in which intimate diversions are followed by unconvincing public events, battles and rebellions. The psychological characteristics of the protagonists, the motivations that drive them, the reasons for their decisions are all left unexplained. ""There are great matters at stake"", says Catherine to Potyomkin (Paul McGann), but we are never told what they are. Such rationalizations as do emerge involve the anachronistic importation of late twentieth-century western liberal concerns into eighteenth-century Russian society.<br /><br />Television drama need not seem cheap. This film does. There is a good cast, but the dialogue is empty and its delivery perfunctory, although Ian Richardson's Vorontsov is done well and Brian Blessed is surprisingly well-moduated (and exceptionally quiet) as Bestuzhev. Generally, the cast seems dispirited by the trite, thin, lines they are asked to utter. One hundred minutes spent watching Miss Zeta-Jones will always have its rewards. None the less, she is miscast. Most particularly, her voice is in its nature contemporary and middle class, with its very modern inability correctly to pronounce the letter 'r'; it is unsuitable to the role of an eighteenth century aristocrat and Empress. The set pieces are sparse and unconvincing and the direction humdrum.<br /><br />The story and this cast deserved better than this slight spectacle."

32997_0,"Bears almost no resemblance to the book (unfortunately). Two of these kids are big enough to have jumped the grandmother AND the butler and gotten the hell out of there. They wander around like meek little mice and refuse to question their mothers sanity. They make half-hearted attempts to escape but not really. The boy is the worst when it comes to standing up for the kids. They let this bible-thumping crazy grandmother reek havoc on their lives and their mothers (who's already nuts). She's (the mother) already allowed the grandmother to pay her back for what she considers 17 years of sin. It just goes on and on till the writer and director have decided they're never going to get the book on film. They shrug their shoulders and walk away from the film at the end. This might be a great re-make in a few years with a well-thought-out script, a good director and especially a good cast."
33040_0,"This movie has exceeded my descriptive capacity. It is, without a doubt, one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. Not the worst of the year, not the worst of the decade--one of the worst EVER. Despite the ""name"" cast, the acting was simply embarrassing. It wasn't acting as much as posing. I never did really decide if the dialogue was supposed to be that cliched for its campy effect, or if they really meant it--and the dialogue was the high point of the writing. (Listen to Donald Sutherland's accent, and tell me he wasn't doing a parody.) The script is as disjointed as it is--well, ""silly"" is the only word that comes to mind. The editing is so clumsy that you feel you are looking at a 1st year film school project--and not a good one, at that. Roger Ebert gave it a minimal one star rating, and I can't believe he was so generous. This is a real stinker."

33130_0,"This movie is a real disaster: insulting, with awfully stereotypical acting and an incredibly poor script that one wonders why this movie has been made for.<br /><br />If I had seen that movie as a closeted gay teen, I would have been shocked and ashamed. Fortunately I have seen it first as a (by then openly gay) movie-addict in my twenties, so I could dismiss it as only an embarrassingly bad film. Either you just forget about this miserable movie or you take it as a source for filmhistory, namely how bad, how ridiculous, how homophobic so-called comedies sometimes could be in the sixties (alas, there are not that many of this kind...).

Five minute shot of family chewing on cookies, five minute single take of the family walking along the road and five minute shot of a burning building...on and on.<br /><br />One can make a point about seeing beauty in everyday ""things""...yes, but after an hour and forty minutes of it, all I saw was gray. Performances were good, but everything was so stripped down and bare that I just couldn't connect with any of the characters.<br /><br />Ending was sort of an interesting one, but it is basically a slight escalation in the continuously desolate situation the characters are faced with. Nothing is resolved, and the desolation and despair will continue on.<br /><br />It has some interesting views on society and human nature, but again, so few and far between that whatever message this film tries to make falls to pieces."

33266_0,"Usually when movies are filmed based on true stories, I tend to find out something about what happened before seeing the movie. I was very aware of the Matthew Shepard tragedy from classes at school and TV reports. As well I think there are a few stories that shouldn't be made into movies unless they are handled well. Such as the Oklahoma City Bombing or the Matthew Shepard tragedy. When I heard of this movie and how it connected with the stand up against discrimination campaign I thought it would stand a fair chance and rise above common TV movie meandering. At times it did. But for the most part I was sadly disappointed. On a purely techinical level the filming was not engaging. Few shots really brought the movie alive and MTV has a way of lighting there movies that always look like an episode of TRL. The script itself was not very strong. In fact the most emotionally moving moments of the movie were clips from live news reels and candle light vigils. The attackers were lives were shown as well as Matthew's but all of the attackers dialogue was forced and poorly written. One shot of the movie does stand out. Anyone who was aware of the tragedy is familiar with the one profile picture of Matthew Shepard. While Matthew (Cy Carter) lies in the hospital waiting to die a friend says she will bring a picture to attach to a story being written, so people will know who he is. The picture is that profile. I felt a chill at that moment. Other than that...the acting was weak. Cy Carter met the physical description of Shepard and at moments captured his heart but still left me wanting more. As the attackers, neither actor really brought a fleshed out character. The strongest actor in the movie was the young woman playing Chassity. She really brought out another level to her paper thin character. In one scene her mother is accused of being a lesbian. Chassity says she has no problems with gay people and even works on the gay student union, but when her mother is attacked a side of Chassity comes out. It's okay for anyone else to be gay...but not her mother. It really shows how sometimes people can feel one way but still be conflicted. All in all...this movie leaves the viewer wanting. This tragedy, if it was to be made into a movie at all, and I wish it hadn't...deserved a much better representation than this. Yet still, the message gets through and the important facts of the trial and ensuing panic were represented well. While you feel little for the characters, you understand the effect this had on their lives and of the lives of all americans."

You leave with a trig lesson that just BLEW YOUR MIND!!!<br /><br />This film is so uncannily like my own high school years, I was half convinced it was a straight up documentary for the first ten or twenty seconds.<br /><br />What gave it away was the fact that the actors cast as high school students looked WAY too young (they only looked 23-25, when we were in school, we all looked at least 29). The second thing that was highly suspect was the fact that there was only ONE spontaneous group dance number (during a computer class). Give me a break!!! There is a particularly nuanced supporting roll performed with aplomb by a young upstart actress who never quite flew so high in her later years; Jennifer Lopez as Booker."
33356_0,"This David Hamilton movie is something of a disaster. It has a half-decent story (coming-of-age/love triangle) and a mediocre script. All of Hamilton's usual trademarks are here - stunningly beautiful & innocent young girls, soft-focus photography, lots of nudity, gentle lesbianism, and a romantic soundtrack. There is/was a good movie to be made with the given material & cast, but this is not it. The editing is appalling, and at times the scene shifts seem somewhat disjointed.<br /><br />It's worth remembering that Hamilton was an iconic photographer of his time and experimented with taking his art into the movie field, in many ways pioneering the penchant for photographers in the adult industry to also dabble in video work.<br /><br />However, on the plus side, there are very good performances from Dawn Dunlap (as Laura) and James Mitchell (as Paul), and the soundtrack is quite nice.<br /><br />To summarise, I'd say that unless you're a fan of Hamilton's other work, e.g. Bilitis, Summer in St Tropez, then this is best forgotten.<br /><br />I rate it 4/10."

Instead, it is simply every late-night cable movie you have seen in your whole life chucked into a blender, drank, and explosively shat down your throat. Its sole novelty is the replacement of faux-hick accents (the norm when Hollywood films shitstorms like this) with broken English with eastern European accents and Croatian (with English subtitles).<br /><br />Oksana Orlenko, in the title role, does a decent job in either language, but burdened by a simply awful script and generally not-very-good co-stars, I'm not certain how much I'm just trying to find one redeeming facet of this production in order to justify the disappearance of $6 from my wallet and 107 minutes from my life. If there is one, it certainly is not the direction, the cinematography, the script, the editing, or the lame, heavy-handed (but digitally mastered!) score. God knows it's definitely not the script. Lana's Rain runs through so many laugh-out-loud bad movie clichés that it's hard to believe it was ever made. Speech about how America is where dreams come true? Check. Inept, slow-motion ""action"" scenes? Check. Shoehorned-in romantic subplot that serves no purpose other than providing the obligatory sex scene? Check. Flashback images at the end to remind you of everything that you already saw in the previous hour and a half? Check. Completely unnecessary ""happily ever after"" final scene?

The only reason I watched the entire movie was because, as a woman, seeing the massive revenge against rapists was very satisfying. One of those rare moments in which the woman isn't continually re-victimized. I thought Oldman's performance was a little more natural than that of Rhames, but his was still decent. I can't say all women would gain anything by seeing rapists tortured. It's dicey. I gave it a 3 out of 10. My feeling is that veterans such as Rhames and Oldman should have seen all of the mistakes in dialog and plot consistency and maybe passed on it altogether. If you're up and bored in the middle of the night while it's on a movie channel, you might as well watch it."

An apotheosis of bad taste comes when a paralytic wants to take a leak, so poppa and momma prop him up while Hugo Dugay is rummaging for his pissing gimmick. Mercifully we're saved from seeing his penis but are forced to hear horrible comments about his urination anyway. Alyssa Milano, Sean Penn, Malcolm McDowell, Robert Downey Jr - what a waste of talent."
33941_0,"I remember waiting for this show's weekly segment with such anticipation as a child in the Early 1980's. To watch Michael Knight and his partner and friend Kitt the car battle criminals for the foundation was such a thrill. Today I look at this show and recollect with embarrassment the reasons why I watched it. The reasons as a child as to why I watched this show were simple. It was fast paced, adventurous & suspenseful. But to top it all off it had one of the coolest cars known to man. A car that not only protected Michael Knight, but engaged in full conversations with him. Conversations such as Michael's masculine pursuits were held up to scrutiny in the conversations and if my memory serves me correctly most of these chats were about Michael's roaming eye and how every damsel would fall for him in each episode. The adventures were many and the explosions and fistfights were plenty. At the end of each episode we were all grateful that the west coast of America was safe thanks to one car and its occupant.<br /><br />Today however I can't see the children even being remotely interested in talking cars or for that matter the occupants of these cars. Maybe this is because the technology that was our imaginations has become a reality today and there is now no need for these dated action shows. The imaginations of today are now enthralled by what could be the technology of tomorrow. Or is it that children and adults alike have had enough of the rubbish and unrealistic story lines. We don't care about a car that could never exist and if it did we would be able to afford it or worse it could become like the next DeLorien car. Have we had now had enough of the likes of Michael Knight a man whose stylish leather jackets and sun tan of the early 1980's would now be the object of scorn and pity. Today a poser like Michael Knight would be bottled and beaten and not tolerated and that is just what the feminists would do. In this reviewers opinion! Yes. Knight Rider is very much a product of 1980's kitsch. To watch a re-run like I have today meant blushing with embarrassment at the though that I once found the dialog funny and cool. The story lines are wholly unbelievable and the methods of preventing crime are totally ludicrous. What's worse is the fact that this show has had a stigma far worse than the dodgy fashion and plot lines. This is David Hasselhof a person that is still on the T.V. despite the fact he cannot act and when he tries it is just very embarrassing to watch. Granted I will admit it is very hard to upstage a talking car, even Marlon Brando would have great difficulty in that.<br /><br />Maybe I am have become too cynical and not being fair to the show. But I am justified in my criticism in this review. If you want to reminisce about television shows from your childhood and have a warm loving tone when you do so, then you can definitely find better ones than this load of rubbish. I find that when me and my mates will discuss these shows the A-Team will always be referred to as our favorite where we will mimic characters and talk about particular shows. Whenever Knight Rider is mentioned we will stare at our drinks vacantly in the hope that someone will change the subject quickly. 1 out of 10"
33987_0,"I just briefly checked the ratings here on IMDb on this movie before i rented it. I thought that it was kind of worth watching so i decided to give it a try. It didn't take very long before i realised that i should have stayed away from this movie. I would say this movie is one of the 10, if not 5, worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life! There is so much bad things i could mention about this movie... the acting, the script, the effects etc... I am sick of all relatives to the group that made this film, who comes here and votes 10 stars and say its a great masterpiece better then Twin Peaks with breaking music. If you can find this movie for sale for 1 cent, then maybe, just maybe i would recommend it for you if you are in need of a DVD-cover. Otherwise my best suggestion is for you to keep as far away from this movie as possible. Discrase that it even got released."
34030_0,"I'm so amazed that the actors that starred in this movie did not seem to have any comprehension of what a bad move they were making. I consider the top 5 billed actors to be good to very good, but not in this movie. There was no meaningful story so I guess I can blame the writers. The way the movie was pieced together makes me want to blame the editors. Considering how poor the actor's performances were (who I know are not bad actors), makes me want to blame the director.<br /><br />One of the other IMDb reviewer described it as a ""Big steaming pile of crap"". After watching the movie, I now realize that he might have been understating how bad it is.<br /><br />If you would like to see some very unappealing gratuitous nudity, and you have a brain the size of a pea, then you might like this movie."
34076_0,"There are just so many problems with this show, my mind is boggling as to where to start. Well, I suppose the best place to start is the beginning. <br /><br />The story initially begins during one of the major battles from the previous show, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. A young boy named Shinn Asuka and his family are caught in a crossfire between two mobile suits, one of them piloted by Kira Yamato, the protagonist from Gundam SEED. Although Shinn survives, his entire family is killed, leaving Shinn aghast. Fast forward two years later, Shinn has relocated to the PLANTs and enlisted in the ZAFT military. <br /><br />This show definitely had a lot of potential during the first twelve episodes, which focused mainly on Shinn and all the other new characters. But then the writers decided to switch gears and bring back Kira and the rest of the old cast from Gundam SEED, and they ultimately save the day. What is frustrating about that is Kira has no struggle to speak of. Yet in the last few episodes of this show, the writers decided to make Kira invincible in his latest mobile suit and the climax was insufferably one-sided. Overall, this show is a disgrace to the Gundam franchise.<br /><br />Yoshiyuki ""Kill 'Em All"" Tomino, the instigator of Gundam, is definitely the superior director and I would definitely recommend any of his shows or movies over this lame series anytime . They don't call him ""Kill 'Em All"" Tomino for nothing. No sir."
34120_0,"Big city girl Josie (Mary Sellers) has just arrived back in her small Alaskan hometown for an extended stay with her mother and kid brother, and decides to possibly reconcile with her former high school boyfriend Matt (Jason Saucier) while she's there. Down at the nearby nuclear power plant, illegal chemical dumping (part of an obligatory and half-assed cover-up subplot) has resulted in animated, super-intelligent, radioactive tree roots that are killing everyone off. Victims include an obnoxious sheriff, a female hitchhiker passing through town, a farmer and his wife, a hooker with a heart of gold and a gas station attendant and his pet dog Chester. The roots mostly just trip or strangle people and make a hilarious whip-cracking noise whenever they attack. They also make a (toy) helicopter explode by pulling it about two feet to the ground. During the film's one and only bloody scene, the roots go into a guy's mouth and then poke the eyeball out of a mannequin head. And that's about all she wrote with this dull-as-dishwater waste of time, which would be totally forgotten by now if not for a misleading title change linking it to the notoriously awful camp classic TROLL 2. So be forewarned, no trolls make an appearance in CONTAMINATION.7 (aka TROLL 3). Hell, there aren't even any goblins.<br /><br />And unfortunately, while TROLL 2 failed in an enjoyable awful way, this one fails to reach that film's same level of redeeming unintentional hilarity. Though thoroughly inept, it's also boring, clichéd, slow-moving and far too tame to really be enjoyable. The fact they used inexperienced local ""talent"" to fill out the cast, along with providing these laughably bad amateur thesps with truly rotten dialogue throughout the film, is the only point of possible enjoyment, though even that got old quickly.<br /><br />Probably best known as THE CRAWLERS here in the States, though the version I viewed was titled CREEPERS. Don't know if that's a cut version of this film or not, but I highly doubt it. I'm also not sure of Joe D'Amato's actual involvement since his name (or ""David Hills"" for that matter) is nowhere to be found in the credits. Only one director is listed and that's ""Martin Newlin;"" the same alias used by Fabrizio Laurenti for the Linda Blair/David Hasselhoff film WITCHERY (1988)."
34166_0,"I loved the first season of the Tudors. It was fun and scandalous and wonderful eye-candy. The second season was a huge let down. While the addition of the Pope and the creation of the Jesuits and the take over of the English Church by Henry made for good intrigue, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers continued to show his prowess as an actor, and the rest of the cast does a brilliant job supporting him, the character decisions made by the creators were upsetting. The gratuitous explicit sex continues, which is no surprise and in itself fine. But the brief respect the writers gave their gay/bisexual men in the first season did not carry on into this one. There is barely a touch between the male couple, Boleyn and Smeeton. Instead of showing a sex scene, or even a kiss, between these characters, the creators opt to make it clear that Boleyn is gay by showing him anally rape his wife. I was so shocked (and offended) by the decision I could not bring myself to finish the series. Up until that episode I had been only half as invested in the season as I had been in the first. And afterward, I decided it was just not worth my time. I was really looking forward to catching up with this show. What a waste."
34210_0,"Leave off without Off Season<br /><br />After having driven to the Viking hotel in Portland (ME) from Manhattan during the off season, a playwright and his girlfriend settle in to their new home only to find strange things abound. They both begin to experience the strange things, yet neither seem interested in revealing those experiences to each other - for no good reason. The oddities soon take a toll on their relationship physically manifesting mainly against the girlfriend (probably because she doesn't walk around in the hotel room naked like any respectable B-Horror actress should). She suffers dearly getting the paranormal flu (who knew the afterlife was so unsanitary?!), booted from her job (as a part time librarian?), dumped by the boyfriend (for the company of the day drinking town hooligan; a guy that hangs out across the street from the hotel and flips off the manager when confronted - oooooh....scary), and a sweltering shiner (beware of the dangerous library book). No worries for her though because a dead relative that talks through the answering machine (only after the beep) to her will help guide her through the advances of dirty old men wielding small cactus, long haired freaky wet men cowering in the shower (don't get hopes up for any nudity!), and homicidal book smacking psycho chicks. Our heroine triumphs in the end writing her own best seller exposing the exploits of another best selling novelist that co-incidentally lived in the same hotel before she arrived. <br /><br />Believe me when I say I am making this movie sound better than it is. It is an incredibly bad movie that attempts weakly to capture small town colloquialisms by spinning them into a yarn of mystery and horror (which it doesn't). The problem is the writing and the direction. The plot is almost impossible to follow (not in a good way) and is filled with a myriad of ridiculousness (would the makers of this movie please decide if it is cold or warm or what is the actual weather pattern in Portland during the off season! Sheez!). For the psychological thriller fan, the story is not tight and the characters hold no interest. For the B-horror fan, this movie is missing all the elements - no gratuitous nudity, no slashing, and no chasing. <br /><br />The only screams are coming from the people that paid to see this movie. <br /><br />Don't say I didn't warn you!!"

34300_0,"Boogeyman 2 is the sequel to one of the worst horror films I have seen during the last 10 years.This sequel is better than the first part...but it also is a pathetic crap.Besides the good presence from Tobin Bell and Reneé O' Connor,there is nothing to recommend in Boogeyman 2.The screenplay is horribly bad,the characters are completely generic and the movie is tremendously tedious from its first scene to its last one.Jeff Betancourt,who was the editor of some very competent movies (like The Good Girl or The Ruins),made his first work as a director in this movie,and it would be better if he goes back to editing movies,because the direction from Boogeyman 2 is pathetic for many reasons,but mainly,because it never finds a good tone and it is very chaotic.Boogeyman 2 belongs to the worst kind of horror cinema and I suggest you to avoid this big piece of crap.As I said,it's better (or,more properly,less bad) than the first part,but it's still unbearable and painful to watch."

There is really no reason for this movie, and it is at times boring. Sure, it is a wee bit entertaining, but I was laughing more than anything. In fact, I never got the least bit scared, not even a rapid heart beat. My God, ""Showgirls"" was scarier than this. The title is outrageous. Wasn't it two summers ago? Or did we stay in the same year. A much better title would have been ""I Still Know"". And that should've been it. That would have been perfect.

34391_0,"I do not blame the game, but myself, for losing hundreds of hours that with ease could have been spent doing something constructive/more fun. It took me a good two years before realizing the complete nonsense of actually devoting even a minute to this game, and at the point of recognizing this fact it took me less than no time to stop playing for good. Why is it nonsense? <br /><br />The game is horribly linear. Play it through with one character and you've explored all there is to it. Quests come in 3 variations (""Wow!"" is pretty far from the first thought that comes to mind when seeing that). Character development comes to a halt at level 20, after which little hope is in sight. At top level all you can do to further build up your character is to grind, grind, and grind some more for equipment that is slightly better than what you already have. Character skills are dead and stale. Exploring non-existent. Character progress is lost. PvP is another means to drain you of yet another couple of hundred hours and dreadfully predictive unless you are a dimwit, reaching ne plus ultra meaning (take a wild guess) better equipment.<br /><br />At level 70 _everything_ boils down to getting better equipment? For what purpose? To be able to get even better equipment. I would chuckle if I did not feel sorry for everyone still playing. The economic aspect of the game is lacking in so many areas it's painful to even think about it.<br /><br />Sure, there are a few pros as well. Playing with your friends is fun for a while, but there are better and more intricate games that actually give something in return while doing so. Clearing an end-game instance is fun the first time, after which it gets repetitive. Same with PvP. This game is flawed in so many ways it's a wonder that people continue to play it.<br /><br />Wow is a hoax and you're all being cheated."
34436_0,"Tagline: An uninteresting failure with a competent display by Elijah Wood Review by Neo: To say I am disappointed, it is a clear understatement. It is rare that a film can possesses such a fine display from one of the co-stars in Elijah Wood, but still ends up a total disappointment. Day Zero doesn't work like a movie, it doesn't provide a movie experience, but at no times, does it feel real either. It is a film with an adequate premise about the possibility of drafting civilians into the war against terror. For once, I just cannot see any redeeming factor for this movie. With just Wood showing potential, the rest of the cast with Chris Klein in particular produces an emotionless and petty display that is more wooden than anything. Likewise, Jon Bernthal, tries hard, but fails to convince owing to lack of on-screen charisma. Basically, a film is bounded to fail, when the story does not work, nothing really tend to happen and along with fail performances from the leads. Day Zero is easily a big disappointment.<br /><br />The movie goes like this: Three best friends are about to face the prospect of being drafted into national service on the war against terror. With just 30 days left, the film shows how different people react, feel and do in the remaining days before reporting on duty.<br /><br />Let's focus on the rare display of positiveness coming out of this film. Elijah Wood has been trying for years to shed his image of being typecast as Lord of Rings and there is no doubting that he is one actor with potential to burn. I thought he was more than convincing in his role and the way he depicted the torment of an artist who is at loggerhead with the fact that he is going to be killing human beings face to face is almost daunting to endure. Being the only shining light in the film, including a memorable moment in front of the mirror where he screams at himself. It is certainly a rare moment of quality that fails to lighten up the dullness of the flick. As mentioned before, Chris Klein may have the leading man looks, but his acting is far too disconnecting to the audience. Despite having the chance to play a fairly conflicted role, Klein is not impressive and fails miserably. While, Jon Bernthal actually tries to act and does slightly better than Klein, it is needless to say that the guy has no on-screen charisma and perhaps will fit in better on the small screen than the big one.<br /><br />All in all, Day Zero seems to want to express some sort of message about the divided opinion on the war against terror (i.e. how it is the other peoples' war or how we are defending our country), but in reality, it never hits on these issues seriously. Instead the film tries to focus on how people and humans react to this situation and how ordinary people will be affected by issues like these. While it is interesting to think about the prospect, the filmmaker fails to add an human touch to the proceeding and the effect is by the 45 minutes mark, the audience is looking at their watches, thinking, when is this film going to end. By the time, it ends, I am unable to feel or even try to feel for what has happened, as the film is impossible to relate to and almost difficult to connect. Day Zero is really a film that probably deserves zero marks, but for the performance of Elijah Wood, there are some brownie points given  (Neo 2009) <br /><br />I rate it 4/10"
34481_0,"BLOODEATERS (which I saw the theatrical trailer for many years ago and laughed at), and TOXIC ZOMBIES are the same film which I discovered by accident after renting it. I had heard terrible things about both titles but as a zombie movie fan, I tend to fall prey to my inner hunger to see guts ripped out and devoured onscreen by pasty-faced freaks, often against my better judgement. This film was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be--although it's no masterpiece, either. The film is padded out, has terrible, wooden acting, a ludicrous script,awful zombie makeup, and yet somehow it doesn't fall flat on its face... well, not entirely. On the plus side, there is a small but decent amount of gore effects (severed limbs, bullets through head and neck, guts seeping out of a dead body) and the soundtrack (similar to John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN) is actually quite eerie and effective, rendering the film a tad more suspenseful than it has a right to be. The zombies, not truly being undead but just drugged out homicidal maniacs, are the result of being sprayed by a secret government herbicide, and thus die all too easily (as any normal person would). The film needed more zombies, more victims, more gore and more action. It has its moments and a certain creaky, campy charm, but suffers mightily from its amateur cast and crew and is paced only slightly faster than your average snail and has about as much intelligence. Not a bad rental if you're hard up for zombie fare. I give it a 3 out of 10 stars."
34526_0,"When the executives watched the dailies of this film, did they really sit there and think it was good? Could they actually watch this muddled mess and think that the public would take to this crap? It is films like this that remind me how foolish Hollywood really thinks the audience is. They seem to think that as long as you have a couple of recognizable faces in the film, it means that it is going to be box office gold. But we are not that stupid. As a film goer I need a good story, good direction, and some good a acting. This film contains none of this. There is one funny part in this film and that is when Will Smith tells Whoopi there is a white man at the door. But we already saw that in the commercials, so there is nothing really to look forward to. This is really inexcusable garbage. I don't even know what 3/4 of this film is about. This is a film about a sperm bank mix up. In it you have a stereotypical dumb blond, an elephant chasing a bike, a bear, a monkey, a monstrous sounding nurse and too many more ridiculous situations that don't add anything to the film. Whoopi Goldberg started off doing silly but funny comedies, now she either does bad films or films that are too self important. She is still one hell of a funny lady but what she saw in this film besides a paycheck is an enigma wrapped inside of a riddle embedded in a mystery. The only good thing to come out of this is Nia Long got introduced to Will Smith and she later appeared on his television show. She is a great young actress and I am glad that she has broken into Hollywood. But the rest of the film is just plain terrible."

Be afraid, very afraid of this movie. It will totally waste about an hour and a half of your life. I just feel like i should get some sort of compensation for torturing myself with this abomination of a film. If i could do any kind of web design i would make a site dedicated to warning people about this ""HORROR"". One thing that could have slightly improved this was if the girl took her clothes off at any point. it is cold in the movie, but she could have shown something more than her nice belly, which by the way for me was the highlight of this poor project."
34616_0,"""Treasure Island, Pirates of"" is how it should read. It's just another remake of RLS' classic novel with extreme artistic liberty taken in order to add a female ""pirate"" to the crew and really make it inane. Jim Hawkins is a bit older than the book had described and will probably not even attract the adolescent crowd. But what prompted this reviewer to post may become a future blooper trivia question. It was when Long John Silver (Lance) tells one of his crew that he would ""put a bullet"" in his head, and there is no way that a pirate would refer to a pistol ball as a bullet. I know, small detail but it makes this a B movie at best, and won't surprise this reviewer at all if it goes straight to DVD at release. It's a made for television movie if you don't care about accuracy. I feel it might just be an attempt to use the other BIG pirate movie popularity along with the title wording twist to leech some of the box office earnings. It was the worst movie of the year so far in MHO*.<br /><br />*my humble opinion."
34661_0,"I just can't sell this movie folks, I thought it was dreadful. I'm someone who is normally content with both director {Joseph Kane} and star {Sterling Hayden} but here they are mired in weak plotting, bad acting and even worse accents. It also purports to be something of a mystery, which is daft since there isn't one!. Flimsy fights come and go, as do cheese laden songs, while the dialogue is as stilted {read from auto-cue it looks like} as can be. Republic Pictures do have many a fine B movie in the locker, but this isn't worthy of Z movie status.<br /><br />The plot sees Hayden as Tim Chipman, who returns home to find his father, owner of the family logging company, has been murdered. With money owed and a shifty rival in the offering, can Tim solve the mystery, fight off the baddies and once again move logs? Adapted from a novel written by Dan Cushman, of which I haven't read, I honestly don't know if the source material was any good to begin with? But this just doesn't work, either as an interesting story or as a competently executed one. Some decent train sequences catch the eye, and the location work at Glacier National Park is pleasing, if not helped by the less than standard Trucolor print. But really it's not even a time filler of a picture. 3/10"

He is in a position to make a difference and he should open his eyes consciously and look at what is really happening here and real see it and understand the pain being caused.Thumbs down to every producer,actor and director on this movie.Thumbs up to SHARK for getting the story out and to any sponser who pulls out.Thumbs up to Paul McCartney.Thumbs up to ... tried so valiantly on LOTR to stop this crap happening on film sets..Animal or human, undue suffering is not required.Here,in Africa, UK ,Mexcio,Canada ,or anywhere.Undue suffering in Afirca,Dafur and elsewhere like hunger must end."

34841_0,"Julia Roberts made her first credited film appearance in this late 80's girl band movie. Four girls and a token guy, a geeky one at that, travel to a beach coast roadhouse to be the summer house band. When the owner takes a liking to them, they could be headed for Europe where his friend can set the girls up. Are you kidding me? These girls don't sound good enough for that kind of opportunity. The girl band is headed by Family Ties girl: Justine Bateman on lead vocals; Britta Phillips is on lead guitar; Julia Roberts is on bass; Trini Alvarado is on drums. They all seem to have been cast with big hair in mind, popular in the late 80's. Scott Coffey is the token male on keyboards. The girls are all different clichéd types: Phillips is the simpleton stoner with an over-abundance of brainless comments; Roberts is the slut girl supposedly; Alvarado is the tough girl that falls for geeky Coffey! Of course that would never happen in real life. Bateman's character isn't fleshed out enough for us to know how to identify with her. She comes off as street savvy, but then melts into Liam Neeson's arms. He plays the club owner where the girls stay for the summer, and he is far too old for someone of Bateman's ilk, as portrayed in this movie. I didn't really believe he was ever that interested in her. The subplot about the guy gang is ludicrous and serves no purpose. The 80's synthesizer bridging music is annoying at times. Deborah Harry, of Blondie fame, has a cameo as sort of an acquaintance of Neeson's. The film has a couple of funny moments, but is mostly forgettable.

The main female character is a bit on the plump side, and she quickly shows off her assets by taking a shower after a swim (Too bad the lighting is pretty dismal and she's the kinda girl that wears panties under her swimsuit) Needless to say the shot of her getting out of the pool confirms that this chick has got some junk in the trunk. A rare occurrence in most movies who's producers seem to be convinced all men enjoy looking at anorexic women with boob-jobs. At this point I still had high hopes.<br /><br />Once again the have an example of characters that are supposed to be in school, and still under their parents wing, but look to be pushing or over 30. The leads girlfriend in the flick looks about 31 (although I must admit she keeps in shape as she spends ample time in a bikini) Anywho, the acting is pretty stiff, but not terrible (Except for maybe Thor), that's the best I can say about the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The quality of the picture is pretty dismal throughout, with the ending being almost unwatchable because it was filmed outside in the dark, the few effects are for the most part non-effective (except one involving poor ol Preacher). The story itself make no sense, and the scares are literally non-existent in spite of several attempt to try and produce a jolt. Attempts at suspense fall flat. There is big hair though and to further confirm the fact this flick was made in the 80's, has a soundtrack that was almost surely made entirely on one of those big ass sampler keyboards you used to play around with that were on display when you first walked into Sears circa 1984."
34931_0,"<br /><br />Oh, man....I finished watching this movie a couple of hours ago and I'm still laughing hysterically when I think about it. This movie is so bad that it becomes an undeniable must for everyone who's into bad cinema. The worst possible cinema actually, this is stuff like Edward D. Wood made it. Of course, I still respect the efforts that cast and crew put into this but you can't help but roll over the floor and laugh. This is Japanese SciFi cult ( even though they used American actors, they STILL dubbed it...badly ) coming to you straight out of the era when cinema actually had evoluated a lot. But The Green Slime didn't join this trend. Prepare yourself for some amateurish cinema, yet made with a lot of love and passion for the genre.<br /><br />The story is about a blob of green mucus coming straight from outer space. It got here as an uninvited visitor when some heroes destroyed an asteroide. By the way...forget about Armageddon !! The Green Slime really shows you how to blow up an big block of rock. The mucus has the ability to build itself up to green one-eyed midgets with an elephant trunk and they make adorable noises. I assure you, one look at them and you're immediately sold...these little critters stole my heart. Naturally, they don't come with good intentions !! They go after everything that is human and they suck up energy...how ? Don't bother to ask yourself that question...The ""scriptwriters"" didn't bother neither. In between, all the inevitable clichés aren't forgotten. So, as you can see, the special effects and costumes are next to none but it sure doesn't stop there ! Don't forget the space-station and rockets on wires, the cardboard sets and the acting that is really Oscar worthy. *cough*cough*<br /><br />Finally, They're are the small but highly memorable and hilarious little aspects about it. For example, the theme song is terrific !! You'll feel the urge to buy the single of that asap since it's sooooo catchy. And a very honorable mention goes out to Robert Horton's haircut. Heck, I would give this movie a rating 10 out of 10 if only for his flawless head of hair. No matter how many helmets he puts on and off ... no matter how many dangerous stunts he has to perform, his hair remains perfectly combed all the time. Truly a haircut you can set your clock to !"
34977_0,"""Balls of Fury"" is an absolutely dreadful comedy. It amazingly would work better as a drama (not much better). With most films, I can find some redeeming quality. I looked hard and I this is what I found on this. The main character was slightly more tolerable than one would expect from such a poor movie. Christopher Walken was occasionally funny, simply because of his delivery...and well, that's it. Other than that, there are only negatives. Every joke could be seen by anyone a mile away. I could practically give the entire outcome of the film, including all the jokes, halfway through.<br /><br />The plot, if you can call it that, started off slightly promising, but quickly became too stupid. Randy Daytona was a ping pong child prodigy. His father bet on him, and he lost, so he was killed. 18 years later Daytona works at a bad magic show. He is needed by the FBI to catch a Chinese mafia criminal. He gets lessons from a blind man, and it just gets dumber from there. <br /><br />To go along with all of this, ping-pong just isn't an interesting sport to make in to a movie. It's repetitive and you can only do so much with it. I really hated this, and I have a feeling this will earn a well deserved spot in the bottom 100 very soon.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 83 mins. PG-13 for language and sexual humor."
35020_0,"A bad remake of a bad 1960 film, somebody inexplicably decided that it would play better as a musical. It doesn't. A really weak plot about a carnivorous alien plant made all the worse by putting it into musical form, thus treating us to Rick Moranis' singing ""ability"". Far worse than the original for just awful acting performances, a miserable score, and laughable special FX. I would not even consider seeing this turkey again unless somebody held a gun to my head or the head of a loved one and forced me to. Since that is unlikely, I am thankfully done with any involvement with this pitiful failure of a film.<br /><br />1 out of 10. only because they won't register a zero."
35066_0,"I can only assume people enjoyed this film because it gave them some kind of emotional response and it offers the illusion of depth and complexity where none exists, but ""Chuck & Buck"" is the kind of film that's more or less throttled independent cinema in its crib and paved the way for similarly dire work.<br /><br />""Chuck & Buck"" handles very serious issues: homosexuality, adolescent sexuality, obsession, and so on. I wouldn't dream of denying a filmmaker access to this kind of material, but the filmmaker should be using these tools to plumb actual depths, to say something or have some kind of viewpoint. This is the failure of ""Chuck & Buck,"" and it's what makes the film irresponsible and frankly, bad. These issues are easy ways to push an audience's buttons, but the film reads like the tree rape scene in ""Evil Dead:"" it serves no purpose but to unnerve you.<br /><br />It gets worse: the film isn't even competently made. While the acting is fine, the script is rife with implausibilities and inconsistencies, and Miguel Arteta's direction is painfully one note. The film makes no attempt to explain Buck's living situation at all and refuses to diagnose him. Buck exists as a halfway point between a fleshed out character and a cipher, and this unwillingness to commit to what the hell is actually wrong with him makes it impossible to deem him plausible or not.<br /><br />Characters throughout the film will do things that seem utterly contrary to either themselves or common sense, and the infamous scene between Chuck and Buck late in the film is where it lost me for good. Likewise, the denouement of the film is far too pat for something like this, and mars an already stretched-thin credibility.<br /><br />If the film had been merely bad I could ignore it. But it becomes more or less offensive when you consider the messages it essentially offers on homosexuality and to a lesser extent, women. ""Chuck & Buck,"" whether intentionally or not, essentially equates homosexuality with mental illness and discomfort and never changes that tack. Likewise, the only female character the film seems to like/favor is Beverly, essentially a sexless, matronly creature.<br /><br />My classmates seemed to enjoy the film, but I found it too reprehensible and poorly made to respond with anything other than absolute disdain. Avoid."
35110_0,"Totally miscast - Emilia Fox is too confident, beautiful and elegant to play the plain, awkward, painfully shy second Mrs De Winter. Charles Dance is too old to play Max De Winter (he's supposed to be 15 - 20 years older then her, not 30) and he lacks any sense of darkness or anger. Even Manderley itself is dreadfully unimpressive. Only Diana Rigg, as Mrs Danvers comes anywhere near creating a character similar to the book.<br /><br />The directing is of the 'point and shoot' variety, with no subtleties.The one trick, with Mrs Danvers and the light, is lifted straight from Hitchcock.<br /><br />In fact the whole thing has no sense of mystery or doom or tragedy. There is no chemistry between the leads, despite the script showing them kissing passionately at a time in the book when he barely touches her. There's no romance between them, in fact their kisses seem awkward and forced, and a bit disgusting, given how much older than her he looks (not to mention his lack of sex appeal and passion) The script itself is terrible, deviating from the book, having her challenging him at a time when in the book, she can barely speak to him.<br /><br />If you love the book, like I do, don't bother with this. Watch the Hitchcock version, with its great acting, sense of tragedy and doom, deep romance and a script practically lifted from the book, instead."
35156_0,"It's amazing that this first 1950s Hercules film was the stimulus that led to bazillions of Hercules and Maciste films over the next 15 years. Why is this so hard to believe? Well, you'd expect that this film would be really, really good since it was such an important film--and you'd be 100% wrong. This mish-mash film was just as bad as many of the later films and is only marginally watchable. Not surprisingly, it has passed into the public domain--after all, who would want to renew rights to this film?! <br /><br />Some of the film's problems may or may not exist in the original Italian print. I don't know, as I have only just watched one of the English dubbed versions. The biggest and most obvious problem are the voice actors--their voices are too mechanical and bigger than life--so much so that they seem nothing like real people at times. The original Italian voices might be a lot better. Another problem (mostly for history freaks like myself) is that the films are a bizarre melange of both Greek AND Roman mythology--with Roman and Greek names interspersed throughout the film and the stories often bear little semblance to the originals. This is very sloppy but could also be the fault of the dubbers--perhaps the original film was based only on Greek or Roman characters--not both. Maybe in the original Italian it all made more sense.<br /><br />However, despite the sloppy dubbing, another major problem is that the film has too much in the way of plot. There are enough stories for two films. Why they chose to combine the story of Jason and the Argonauts seeking the golden fleece (a Greek tale) AND Hercules (Roman) dealing with an annoying king and his really annoying son is beyond me--especially because both characters could easily have several films of just their own adventures. In fact, with the story of Jason, huge portions of the tale are missing (such as the most important part--his relationship with Medea and her father) and the Hercules one simply doesn't look anything like the classical tales--nothing.<br /><br />The film has a few fun moments, but overall it looks cheap and sloppy--like most Hercules films. Some of the characters make no sense at all (such as the princess who loves Hercules but fights with him when Herc sets out to do EXACTLY what she'd asked him to do) and some are so one-dimensional they looked like they were written by a 3rd grader. If you LIKE cheap and sloppy films (I know I sure do), then this is definitely for you. If not, then see the Disney version. It's also very bad history and bastardizes the story terribly, but is still much closer to the original source material than this silly film."
35200_0,"The movie clearly hits home with some people, but for me I'm afraid it missed the mark.<br /><br />From the outset the acting appeared somewhat B-movie-like. Some characters overacted, the script felt unnatural and some of the lines spouted were just clichés from a phrase book.<br /><br />The lead guy was OK - his acting was clearly what the producers spent their money on. By no means an Oscar-winning performance, he did grab the spotlight but only really thanks to the quite terrible acting around him.<br /><br />The story is OK - that's all though, ""ok"". Not great, not inspiring. Nothing new. I only just made it to the end but constantly wished it could have been forwarded.<br /><br />Seeing as most people here seemed to enjoy it, I can hardly tell you to stay away but it is in no way shape or form a great movie."
35246_0,"This left-wing comedy is so very boring that it doesn't even have the strength to properly annoy me. Its support for Communist rebels and its disdain for Reagan and everything that he stood for is just so idiotic and trite. Weaver is her usual uncharismatic self, and Chase has never been this unfunny. But there's hardly anybody who'd have been funny with this script. It amazes me that someone actually went through the last draft of the script and actually thought ""yeah, this one will be good; let's spend some millions and make a helluva picture!"". If you are interested in reading my phony biographies of Weaver and other Hollywood morons, contact me by e-mail."
35291_0,"Tootsie was very funny in it's time. But this that is sort of like Tootsie in reverse, was not as funny. And listening to some of the jokes make me wonder why was this movie not rated R, I mean some of the jokes make the American Pie movies seem Nc-17. It was not all that funny, through most of the movie, I laughed for putting in the effort for trying. The story begins with Terry(Joyce Hauser) is very upset when she does not win a Journalist contest. Feels she is not taking seriously because she is a pretty female. And is pretty annoyed that her brother Buddy(Billy Jacoby--William Jayne now) has pined up several naked women in his room. So she pretends to be a guy, and changes schools, in hopes to get some respect. During that time she befriends Rick Morehouse(Clayton Rohner, you remember him from G vs E), keeps getting crossing unpleasant paths with the School Bully(The Karate Kids, William Zabka), and his pursued by Sandy(Then unknown Sherilyn Finn). It was not totally bad, Billy Jacoby seems to steal most of the movie has Terrys sex crazed brother. It was an alright 80's flick, but not a classic."

Fritz Lang is just base jumping in the cemetery...<br /><br />The thing I hated the most - apart of the lame of this - so called - movie - is the music. It's just SO FAKE !!!

35381_0,"to lie and sneak around to get what they want. That is basically what Lola does and urges Ella to do in order to get to do things that her mom won't let her. I didn't think it was very cute, and it makes all the pretty girls at school out to be b*itches, and that includes Lohan's character, Lola. She really wasn't that nice and felt she had to brag to be popular in school. And it wasn't very funny. It felt very childish, almost like the target audience was 7 year old girls. You could definitely tell it was a Disney film. And to be aimed for young kids, they have Lola looking to be with a much older guy, and they have him drunk most of the time he's in the film. And they have Lola and her friend running around NY city be themselves. Those aren't exactly the things you want to show your 7 year old is the proper thing to do.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not very good. Don't watch it if you are over 10."
35426_0,"I don't mind mindless, escapist entertainment ... in fact, that's why I rented this DVD. Having seen the original XXX, I knew this wouldn't be that great of a movie, but I was counting on the action sequences to pull me through.<br /><br />Well, apart from the beginning of the movie, XXX:State of the Union was a huge let down from even my small expectations. I guess the budget wasn't high enough for cool, exciting action sequences so they substituted old-school 80s style scenes for most of it, and suffice to say, there's a reason why most action movies don't do that stuff anymore -- it's boring. And since the action sequences are the only reason to watch something like this, and they suck, there's no real reason to give this movie even a moment's consideration.<br /><br />The plot involves Darius Stone (Ice Cube) replacing Vin Diesel's character as the new, improved xXx and trying to foil a plot against the President of the United States. Darius proceeds to throw people around, impress the ladies, blow stuff up etc etc etc. The basic concept is a hip-hop James Bond, and while it sounds like a cool concept that you couldn't possibly mess up, no, these guys messed it up... its not Ice Cube's fault, he's no actor but I've seen him do better than this if the movie has a script and some direction."

In that shape he can't play super secret agent, but only a Santa Claus. Anyway the worst thing in this movie are fight scenes.Seagal is doubled in fight scenes by another actor. It is very sad for me ,because I practice martial arts and I admire Seagal's Aikido abilities . I think that he is cheating his fans doing something like this. Blacdawn is very boring, small budget B-movie .What else? Bad acting and horrible story. And the finale of this film with helicopter and a bomb....<br /><br />NO COMMENT !!"
35516_0,"God this is terrible journalism. I can't see the point of discrediting actual issues by mixing them up with spiritual goofs and use eccentric fanatics as front figures for let's say global warming. When you get so many hurricanes in one year that you run out of names, there's something going on. The last show I saw, they tried to wave away the dangers of passive smoking. I'm curious about who's really paying for this show. I get the feeling that there is some hidden lobbyism in this program.<br /><br />I used to consider Penn & Teller two funny magicians (except for the lousy acting in ""Sabrina""). Nowadays I think they are sellouts who's obviously not doing well with the magic business (cause then they wouldn't have to take part of this crap, would they?). I mean, who listens to a magician when it comes to global warming and long term problems with genetic manipulation?"
35561_0,"Wow...just wow. i have never seen a more blatant rip off of Star Wars and Star Trek in my whole life. This movie was made in 1978, right after the release of Star Wars, and a while after Star Trek. and it really shows. This movie copied everything from lightsabers to phasers, to the cardboard sets. But while Star Trek was endearing, this was not.<br /><br />Now we're on to movie 15 of our 50 chilling classics and let me just say first of all that THIS IS IN THE WRONG MOVIE PACK. This OBVIOUSLY should be in the sci-fi pack. There is nothing horror movie related about this. So WHY it's in a horror pack, like ""Death Rage"" i have no idea. They really have to preview these movies before they put them in the pack. At least put the genres together correctly. that would be like putting ""Abbott and Costello Meet the invisible man"" in the Western box set. If i wanted to see sci-fi, i'd have bought the Sci-fi pack.<br /><br />Another problem with this movie is how it's titled ""War of the Robots"". which usually entails that Robots are fighting each other. Now there are robots in this movie, but they look so pathetic it's incredibly amusing. Every robot looks exactly like a human with a blonde mullet and a silver jumpsuit. FEAR THE ROBOTS! and you don't even learn that they ARE robots until halfway into the movie. But the robots aren't even the main villains. The main villains are these old people. Yeah. terrifying. if a movie is called ""War of the robots"" then i better see robots BATTLING EACH OTHER! that's like me calling the movie ""Clone Wars"" ""The Tusken Raider battle"". Sure they're in there, but they're not the main concern.<br /><br />This movie also runs far too long. 100 minutes for a cheap Star Wars/Trek rip off is really overkill. None of the characters are endearing, except for the alien. he's pretty cool. and Julie's actually pretty hot.<br /><br />Basically a professor and his assistant are kidnapped and it's up to john (kirk ripoff) (god i hated that guy) and his crew to save them because apparently the aliens kidnapped at just the wrong time when if the professor's gone, the city will explode. Man, talk about your bad timing. Now in this film, they never really give you the alien's side of the story. They're meant to seem evil and uncaring, but their reasoning for what they're doing isn't really evil, they just want to survive. However, instead of making the villains more human (no pun intended) they cartoonishly villainify them, not to mention make the professor and the assistant (lois) switch sides so many times it incredibly confused me.<br /><br />All this movie made me want to do is watch the real star trek. The special effects in this were LAUGHABLE. In star trek at least the projectile showed up on screen as a beam of light. and that was 10 years ago. Here all they did was have a plastic gun flash a light with some sound effects. and the funny thing is, in the second half in the movie, they FORGOT to put in the sound effects. That's just sad. This movie tried so hard to jump on the bandwagon, but failed so miserably. I wouldn't have even seen it if it wasn't in this box set. But i repeat. IT SHOULDN'T BE IN A HORROR BOX SET! ""War of the Robots"" gets 2 ripped off ""Star"" titles, out of 10."
35606_0,"This watered-down social commentary about the caste system among NYC snobs and their domestic help is as esoteric as the book that inspired it. Given a title that promises biting wit, bitch fights, and outrageous behavior, one wakes up the morning after watching the film curiously empty; not only does he not remember a single scene from the film, but he forgets he saw the bloody thing in the first place. Laura Linney's usually electrifying screen presence is dumbed down to a few tantrums and forced smiles, all meant to imply, I suppose, the shallowness of a rich and privileged life. The usually wonderful Paul Giammatti fares no better, coming off as a fat stupid lout whose dialogue was apparently written by someone who watched too many Lifetime movies. In fact, the whole endeavour is EXACTLY like a Lifetime movie: mind-numbingly insipid, told from the point of view of the oppressed woman (here represented by the horribly miscast Scarlet Johansson), complete with sistah support (Alicia Keys) and one of the most boring gay guys you've ever seen on film. Love interest WASP Dopey the Wonder Boy rounds out the cast of caricatures as a down-to-earth Harvard graduate with a sob story and dimples, and of course he's nothing like his dumbass friends. He really wants to date the nanny. Really. Okaaaaaaaaaaay.<br /><br />But I could forgive all of that junk if the film had dared to plumb the depths of the social strata with which it purports to be familiar. But it doesn't, it carefully flits across the top of the upper crust society, never landing anywhere, and we frustratingly see only glimpses of tantalizing gossip: What the hell does Mrs. X exactly do all day long that takes her away from her weirdly-named son (Grayer)? The movie won't tell us, preferring to keep its mouth shut and devoting the entire hour and a half to Annie's moral dilemma in staying with Grayer instead of moving on with her life. It's an admirable quality for a protagonist, but also a very boring one. What I wouldn't give to see Mrs. X on a bender, eating mini donuts in the back of her limo wearing only a fur, or flirting with a doorman or something. ANYTHING. Did anyone ever see Valerie Perrine in that dumb movie with Ally Sheedy years ago, where Sheedy was her maid? The ultra-rich Perrine was fantastic, saving all her bits of aluminum foil so she could recycle them and make a few cents, mashing up all the soap slivers in the house into a big ball so she could make ""soap for the servants' quarters"". This is what I wanted to see, rich people gone weird.<br /><br />Anyhoo, the movie ends pretty much as you might expect, Mrs. X becomes enlightened, etc etc etc. You've seen it all before if you've ever watched five minutes of any Lifetime movie."
35651_0,"Some events are just so ironic that they just seem too weird to be true. One of the best examples, at least in my opinion, is what happened to Chevy Chase. You see, in the '80s he was one of the top stars, with movies like ""Vacation"" and ""Fletch"". Now, he was not friends with the president during that period, nor with the next president, but he was friends with Bill Clinton. That's where it gets bizarre: a few months after Slick Willie took the oath of office, Chase got his own TV show...and it failed miserably, turning Chase into a laughingstock. In short, Chevy Chase went from a star under his enemies to a joke under his friend.<br /><br />To compound this, the show's failure was followed by embarrassing movies like ""Cops and Robbersons"" and ""Man of the House"". I will say that the latter isn't god-awful, but it's not really worth much. Mostly just another story about a son and stepfather trying to bond. If nothing else, I guess that it just seems sad that Chase went from ""SNL"" to this (maybe it's also the flick's status as a Disney movie). But really, Chase has done better than this, as have Farrah Fawcett and George Wendt. Don't make it your first choice."
35697_0,I did not think much of the film SS Experiment Camp This is a sleazy WW2 Nazi horror film which is more like a comedy in parts In this horror film the poor female POW's get raped and groped by The prison guards at the camp. In an amusing part of the film the commandant decides he wants a new pair of testicles and so removes them from one of the hunky guards. The guard doesn't seem to realise he's been castrated until he goes to have sex one of the French prisoners. SS Experiment Camp was banned in th UK from 1976-2005 because it was thought to controversial. it was eventually passed uncut in 2006 because there was not anything in the film that was thought unsuitable.
35741_0,"First, I love horror films including slasher flicks but there is nothing here. They seemed to have had a decent director of photography and the acting isn't bad but sadly the problem is the film as a whole is pointless, senseless garbage. The point (if in-fact there is one) of the film seems clearly just to shock you with over the top gore and mindless violence, a theme I'm entirely sick of and in my opinion a total waste of film-making dollars. Maybe if they spent at least 5 minutes working out a story and characters it would be a decent film. But they sure as heck did no such thing here. Could have been good but this film will not be remembered."

Shortly after in a car Nadja drinks his blood. Meanwhile Van Helsing (Peter Fonda again) is tracking Nadja down with the intention of killing her & he enlists the help of his friend Jim (Martin Donovan) to aide him. Jim's wife Lucy (Galaxy Craze, yeah right that has to be a false name) has met Nadja & taken her back to her apartment where Nadja & Lucy engage in a bit of lesbianism & blood drinking. Van Helsing & Jim become aware that Lucy is under the control of Nadja & in another bizarre coincidence Van Helsing's Sister Cassandra (Suzy Amis) is looking after Nadja's ill Brother Edgar (Jared Harris) who Nadja intends to visit, both Van Helsing's & Jim's desperation to kill Nadja becomes even greater as the people they care for the most are in danger because of Nadja's blood drinking activities...<br /><br />Written & directed by Michael Almereyda I hated just about every second of this supposed film. The script is slow & boring, nothing memorable really happens & is a bit of a chore to sit through. There are only a few character's in the film & I didn't care one bit for any of them, I've heard of minimalist but this is just ridiculous. As a whole Nadja doesn't make a lot of sense & just didn't grip, engage or entertain me in any way whatsoever. So the story & character's are crap can the film deliver in other areas, well no because Nadja is one of the worst looking films I've sat through. If black and white is your thing then fine & I have no problem watching black and white films but Nadja just looks so dark, bland & uninteresting. Then there's the shots which look like they were shot on a faulty camcorder, I'm sorry but they are incredibly annoying as the screen becomes an absolute mess of pixelation & blocks. To add insult to injury director Almereyda uses various irritating techniques to try & convince the viewer that their watching 'art' like soft focus, blurring, slow motion, shots where the background action runs at a different speed to the foreground, jerkiness, skipping frames & bizarre scene transitions. I hated how Nadja looks & was literary praying it would finish within the first 30 minutes but never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I (just about) stuck it out to the end which was also crap. With a pretty reasonable budget of about $1,000,000 Nadja is a poor show, very few character's, no effects & a cheap feel throughout & I have to ask myself where all the money went exactly. There is no atmosphere, scares or tension & while I accept some people may like this black and white art-house nonsense I don't & that's all that matters to me, I simply cannot see how anyone could gain any sort of viewing pleasure from such a film as this & I certainly didn't. There is not one single aspect of Nadja that I can say I enjoyed apart from the central performance by Romanian actress Lowensohn who makes for a striking & seductive female Vampire. Fonda just looks stupid sporting long hair & reflective shades. Forget about any special effects or any proper blood or gore. If you like this sort of bizarre boring, black and white art-house stuff then Nadja is probably right up your street so I can recommend it to you but if your looking for a proper film with decent horror & an actual story then avoid this piece of crap like the plague, that's just my opinion & I'm sure there is an audience out there for a film like Nadja but it's not for me."

Cox has a bargaining chip, the Stanfield family. Eventually Cox and his team baby-sit the hostages and circumvent there own success. Jack then hunts them down, and none of this comes as a surprise due to the formulaic structure of the picture.<br /><br />Some may find ""Firewall"" a difficult film to dislike because it plays all the clichés. It isn't artistic but rather commercial film-making. Borrowing from every film mentioned above, it uses elements from what worked and safely combines them in a coherent, yet unexciting manner. The action scenes don't come till the end of the picture, and those five minutes offer little more than stunt work put on by actors half Ford's age. This is a vehicle for Ford and as the audience we are supposed to subconsciously see this as a practice run at a fourth Indiana Jones film. With such blatant disregard for a plot and even unique action, you can view this movie as the precursor to ""Indiana Jones and the Gated Community"".<br /><br />There is an element that seems realistic and that is the acceptable number of henchmen who are employed by the leader. If they are trying to steal money, then having less people to divvy up the bounty would result in a greater payday. Cox has a modest four men working with him. Unfortunate for both him and the viewer, their lack of common sense is staggering. For example, the family dog Rusty, plays a prominent role when the bumbling fools take him hostage. There should be a logical reason for taking Rusty. With his family already held captive in an unknown locale; I'm sure Jack Stanfield was ready to walk away from them and start a new life. But wait, Rusty is missing too, now I have to comply with their demands. This ultimately destroys the credibility of the screenplay.<br /><br />Performances in the film are convincing. Virginia Madsen is good as the relaxed wife considering the situation her character is put through. My favorite role was of Paul Bettany as a sometimes caring villain that flips a mean pancake. Despite this, director Richard Loncraine has crafted a film that is best described as what a computer would spit out if the command was: thriller. Everything functions to drive the story on its merry way. Lacking character nuances, rich emotions, and beautiful scenery is OK for a suspense film about robbing a bank. Where ""Firewall"" betrays the genre is in not providing twists, originality, or an intriguing story."

35921_0,"Maybe this film had some type of humor I couldn't understand, but I found this to be completely disappointing. I've wanted to see this film ever since I watched the trailer, which made me believe it was a lot like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, or Severance. I was wrong. I am a HUGE fan of those films, but this one just doesn't live up to what I had in mind. I thought it would have way more comedy than it actually did. I mean, it made me actually laugh maybe 3 times at most. To me, the only really good parts were when they found Angus with the sheep and, of course, the sheep killing all the people at Angus's presentation. This film, in my mind, could've been made so much better. But it wasn't."
35967_0,"Two idiots (Ted Danson, Howie Mandel) plan to bet on a horse in a race that's fixed to win. But they have to deal with the Mob and the Mob's head wife who is sleeping around.<br /><br />Wow--is this BAD! I saw it in a theatre in 1986 and remember hating it and being really amazed at how lousy this was. I figured with Ted Danson in it (who was popular from 'Cheers' at the time) it couldn't be bad. Well, I was wrong! He tries but the material is hopeless. Mandel was just annoying. The rest of the cast are just there.<br /><br />Purportedly Danson shot nude scenes for this movie but they weren't in the final cut. Also there were sequences shot with Danson and Mandel imitating old Laurel and Hardy routines (hence the title) but THOSE were cut too. I heard the studio was horrified by the final result (no shock there) and just released it very quietly and it died a quick deserved death. Easily one of the worst comedies of its time. Just painful. Avoid."
36010_0,"Unfortunately this is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen. It does not hold the viewers interest and is boring to the extreme. Acting poor, Sets, terrible. Obviously a low cost budget movie, which should have done every-one a favour and stayed in 1978 where it belongs - Old and unwanted. Sorry - but I doubt if even Bill Collins would have endured this one."

These, together with aircraft recovered from the development and pre-production order for 37, would provide sufficient aircraft for nine squadrons. The total cost would be $2 billion spread from 1959-60 to 1963-64."" (This compared to $2 million for a Voodoo or $3.75 million for a Delta Dart.) <br /><br />The military recommended cancelling the program,""Finally, the cost of the CF-105 programme as a whole was now of such a magnitude that the Chiefs of Staff felt that, to meet the modest requirement of manned aircraft presently considered advisable, it would be more economical to procure a fully developed interceptor of comparable performance in the U.S."" Note that the government was told the Arrow was ""comparable"" to other aircraft and not that it could fly higher, faster, or further than anything else.<br /><br />The film is a little piece of political propaganda and deserves a negative score for being less than useless but the choices are limited to positive values. It actually deserves something closer to -7 out of 10."
36100_0,"This film was made by the crown prince of gore and schlock, Hershell Gordon Lewis. It begins with some young people at a party. All of the sudden, one of the 'untamed youth' begins smashing things--at which point they all join in with the fun. What makes it rather strange is that some of them have knives and even hatchets!! Where did they hide them and what sort of folks bring hatchets?! This opening scene lasts about three times longer than it should and could have used a strong editing. Then, the credits roll along with some of the most nasal and annoying music I've heard in years. Tary Rebanar's voice is high-pitched and annoying enough to raise the dead!! Sadly, strains from his god-awful warbling came and went throughout the film.<br /><br />Once the movie begins, you'll most likely notice how bad the sound is--like it's being filmed with a super 8mm movie camera. As for the acting, everyone seems to over-emote--even the band, whose guitarist and bass player appear to be having grand mal seizures. Really...you need to see them bouncing about to believe it. I am sure the king of subtle, Lewis, instructed them on the finer points of acting and style.<br /><br />What follows are some poorly choreographed fights (I truly think Lewis just yelled out ""okay, start breaking things"" and let them wing it) and MORE destruction of rooms full of cheap furniture. And, like the first time, it seems to go on forever. You'd think these 'youth gone wild' would have gotten bored with this after a while, and so they do. For kicks, then, they fry a guy's hand on the stove, burn newspapers that sit right in front of the camera and smash apart a baby carriage. I especially loved the shot of the baby sitting in a trashcan--just looking at the punks as they did their thing. It was dumb but also kind of funny. Sadly, however, the film didn't stop there. It kept showing more and more and more of the same sort of thing--these kids beating up and humiliating adults time and time again. It really got old very quickly and just looked like padding and made up the bulk of the film. Acting and plot just didn't seem that important. Yet I was also left to wonder how they could do this so many times in broad daylight and yet the cops STILL couldn't figure out who these young whippersnappers were!!! And, considering how loud and obnoxious and noticeable the crazed kids were, you almost thought the cops in the film should have been played by Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder.<br /><br />Finally, to break the monotony of the same old attacks again and again, a group of four nice girls are invited to one of the gang's parties and are drugged and raped. But, instead of this signaling a move to more serious crimes, in the next scene the gang literally goes out and beats up little children playing baseball. I know it was supposed to be shocking but I just thought the whole thing was incredibly silly. And, once again, the scene seemed to go on way too long. However, even though it's a horrible scene, just get a load of that old lady as she watches the attack! I loved her expressions--the type that make Edith Massey seem like a brilliant thespian.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in addition to the old lady being a horrible actress, she also misidentifies who caused the problems--saying that an innocent kid was at fault for attacking an entire gang. And, the brain-addled police seem to think this is reasonable and arrest the boy. They ignore another more credible witness and don't even bother talking to the little kids! Hmm...it seems the police aren't really blind--just really, really stupid! In the following scene, by the way, you learn what else the vicious gang likes to do for fun. They play bumper pool!!! So, as the gang play, the innocent guy who was just arrested comes into the room full of these clean-cut looking thugs and threatens them!!! What part of stupid didn't this guy understand?! He has just shown that he's dumb enough to join this town's police force. Yet, oddly, we see no beat-down--just the gang enjoying six packs of everyone's favorite beverage, Carling Black Label (could they have perhaps been a sponsor!?). What happened to the dumb guy who just threatened to kill them (and without a gun or tank or even backup to help)?! What follows instead is a rape scene that showed a lot more than I'd assumed they could get away with back in 1968.<br /><br />However, apparently the gang didn't forget about the dumb guy and you see them about to exact their revenge. In the very next scene, his girlfriend calls the cops to report the threatening phone calls she got and they respond that there's nothing they can do(?). I think the Keystone Kops would have been an improvement over the police in this goofy town. What follows are more sexual assaults and mayhem until finally, finally the gang is finally stopped in a weird scene where a bike just explodes for no reason. <br /><br />This film, with a few exceptions here and there, managed to make gang violence rather boring. Too many scenes should have been shortened, there were too many attacks and not enough story. All in all, the violence just got old and dull very quickly and the story never made sense as people cannot be THAT dumb! While this is a terrible film in almost every way, for Hershell Gordon Lewis this is NOT among his worst films. No, for that you might want to try MONSTER A GO-GO and THIS STUFF'LL KILL YA. Believe it or not, however, Lewis did make one low-budget films that didn't completely suck--the surprisingly good TWO THOUSAND MANIACS. This proves that if you try hard enough, you're bound to get lucky once."
36146_0,"There is a lot that I love about John Lennon, and a lot that I don't like much about him. I was interested in this film initially, but was not all that impressed. I'll try to explain my problems with it. I suppose I should start by saying that it is not all bad, but anybody who looks at this as ""the"" documentary on Lennon is grossly misinformed.<br /><br />In a nutshell, nearly everything in the film had all been said before. It was the first time I felt like I was watching a remake of a documentary! Some people claimed that it was the first time this part of Lennon's life was shown in a documentary, but there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been said elsewhere, be it on film or in a book.<br /><br />I hated the overused ""talking-heads"" format. I had no need to hear what Gore Vidal had to say, particularly when he went on about Lennon representing ""life"" and Nixon and George Bush representing ""death"". Whatever. I'm not their biggest fan either, but that was pure sensationalism. It's not clear which Bush he was talking about, but Vidal takes every chance he gets to make pompous, oversimplified statements like that.<br /><br />Geraldo Rivera? You've got to be kidding! <br /><br />I just wasn't always sure if the film had anything more to say than ""John Lennon ruled and Richard Nixon sucked."" Does anybody who is going to see this film really need to be told that to the degree that this film tells the audience? While I'm at it, I hated the film's ad campaign. It centered upon the above Vidal quote and counted on people who didn't do their own thinking to applaud it as wholly original and profound. The fact that it bastardized ""War Is Over... If You Want It"" by making it the film's tagline irritated me, especially since the film wasn't supposed to be about war! Even if you read into it and say that it was about a war between Nixon and Lennon, I still say that's a flimsy reason.<br /><br />David Leaf is usually much more impressive than this. I, for one, value his work as Brian Wilson's biographer. This film, however, just seemed to be capitalizing on the current documentary craze. It used to be that a viewer could be enlightened and educated by almost every documentary that made its way into cinemas. Not anymore, though. This one simply staples together other, BETTER documentaries about the same stuff. Want to learn about Lennon? Read a book. Watch better Lennon documentaries like Imagine: John Lennon. That film wasn't perfect either, but at least it showed John at his best and at his worst. The U.S. vs. John Lennon is simply John worship that spends so much time treating him like a legend, it forgets to treat him like a man.<br /><br />I probably would not have felt so negatively had I seen this one on television instead of in a cinema. It was partly produced by VH1, and that's really where it belongs. At least on VH1, it can be taken with a grain of salt alongside I Love the 80s: 1982 and Flava of Love. (Okay, okay, that last part was pretty low, I admit it. I apologize.) I can't say that I hated the whole thing. There were some pretty interesting interviews, particularly the one with John Sinclair. His contribution was the best part of the film. They also made at least some efforts (i.e. two or three I think) to bring in opposing viewpoints so they could say they were being objective.<br /><br />Above everything else, it is always a pleasure to listen to Lennon, even when he wasn't thinking much about what he said. Yes, friends, even Lennons make mistakes. Either way, his interviews were pretty well used in this film. I walked away really wishing that John were still around to state his case for himself retrospectively."

In fact, everyone involved here deserves a, if not physical then atleast a verbal, lash or two.<br /><br />The plotline; Mila Kunis (yes, That 70's girl) plays Rachel Newman, who, thanks to the fact that the writers who obviously never quite understood the original flick, as a child witnesses the final murder of serial killer Patrick Bateman. After growing up, she attends the FBI Academy for serial killer profiling. However, it soon becomes clear that she is quite the psycho herself and starts to hack 'n' slash her classmates that seems to pose a threat to her. Very soon it's just a brainless teen slasher, and not even as a teen slasher is it worthy of your time, however little your time may be worth. Fast forward.<br /><br />There are not many highlights in this movie at all. If you have seen American Psycho, do not, under any circumstances watch this, the flagrant script is enough to eject this straight-to-video release. I don't think that the original screen adaption surpassed the book in quality, but for this sequel the term ""art pollution"" comes in handy. Heavens no."
36236_0,"Trent (Brian O'Connor) and Jimmy (Cameron Smith) are two Nam vet buddies who escaped a POW prison camp only to face worse horrors at home when the past literally comes back to haunt them. They're harassed by a soldier they left behind and a sadistic traitor who helped torture them, and when they're attacked in their dreams, they emerge with real scars (a la A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET). The two deck out in cameo and carry high-powered machine guns into their dreams to fight back after one's wife is raped and killed by a ghost. Dan (GRIZZLY ADAMS) Haggerty is the top-billed guest star. He plays a psychiatrist who tries to ""help"" by holding them at gunpoint, drugging them and tying them up in his office!<br /><br />The premise is somewhat new, but the unconvincing Nam flashbacks look like the stars are playing War Games in the woods behind their house, the dialogue (""Let's do it!,"" ""I'm scared, man!"") is annoying and the action and horror scenes just aren't very exciting.<br /><br />Prolific director David A.

It will not become a part of my collection -- ever.<br /><br />There is no plot. Nothing believable. No chance for a thriller. Nothing to hold you engulfed in the moment along with the characters. Law enforcement would shut down an operation (no pun intended) where kids from wealthy (or not) families just disappear wholesale in big bleeding batches. No care is taken in the selection of the unfortunates, anyone is fair game. The only requirement is that you be mindlessly horny (never question why the perfect 10 has to have you) and extremely naive so much so that it goes beyond belief. The rest is just hack and slash oh yeah, and saw.<br /><br />So, it is just gore for the sake of gore. Pretty sick and in the end just sad. I should add SORRY to the list; sorry that I got SUCKED in (there's another addition) to buying it based on the cover art, hype and names attached to it. Needless to say I am more careful now.<br /><br />Next week I'm going to take my mini-DV to the local butcher shop to see about filming a sequel.

As his second film, he had the extremely difficult task of making an exceptionally well received German film into a palatable form for American audiences. Well, he blew it. Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan were not properly cast. Making her a cardio-thoracic surgeon (a heart doctor) is totally assinine and to be exceptionally beautiful on top of that? Yeah, right. What was Silberling thinking? Lord only knows but I have to say. Forget this one. It is a clunker beyond belief."

But everything else in the film is flat-out so-horrible-and-boring-and-not-even-remotely-fun that it should be avoided at all costs. AT. ALL. COSTS.

At three hours it was a too long for me, but I remember watching Tarzan movies for hours on Saturday mornings when I was his age, including those awful Mike Henry in South America Tarzan movies. This was better than those. So, even though I didn't like it much, I'm glad movies are still being made that a kid can watch and get lost in. One thing I thought was puzzling, they kept introducing characters that they never really did anything with. Steven Waddington was the only supporting character that managed to shine. The history was of course pretty silly, but they ""fixed"" that at the end. It made my son want to know more, so we went on the web and looked up what really happened. Definitely a ""B"" movie, with limited special effects and wooden acting, but still fun for kids."
36461_0,"If you're looking for a movie about giant lizards, this is one you're going to love. It may not be Godzilla, but in some ways the Giant Gila Monster is even better.<br /><br />Admittingly, the special effect of having a giant gila monster is rather weak. If you can't tell, the film merely shows a regular gila monster and uses a few small models of cars and such. People don't like to share the screen with the monster. (One character comments that any number of things could hide in the underbrush, but this monster is so big I'm not sure where he was hiding!) There's no nudity, no gore and it's not really scary at all (the sci-fi eerie music is kind of nice, though). The first characters disappear without ever really showing us anything about their disappearance.<br /><br />And yeah, a large part of the movie focuses on hot rods and kids just hanging out (with some clever editing, you would never even know this was a so-called ""horror"" film). But the film is in the 1950s, and gives you a 1950s feel... which is nice.<br /><br />You won't want to see this if you're looking for a scare, but for a fun time and a bit of nostalgia, this is a good choice.

36551_0,"Primal Force gave me as much laughter as any comedy I can remember in recent years. It was so bad throughout, it was almost good and I HAD to watch it again to make sure I wasn't just imagining it. <br /><br />There is always scope for a cliché low budget sci-fi/horror/action film to go wrong. If Primal Force was to be compared to meal, it would have to be 'Cheesy Chips'. Students will know what I am talking about.<br /><br />Much has already been said about the wastage of Ron Perlman's talents on this movie, how badly made it is, how stupid the plot is, how low budget it is, how bad the effects are, how unconvincing the killer mutant baboons are, etc, etc. And all that is true in my opinion.<br /><br />However, if what you want is a low budget b-movie that's as tacky as fondue and makes you laugh out loud, then this is just your cup of tea. <br /><br />I feel there is something to like about genre films like this. Primal Force promised to be really bad right from the start and for me it delivered the goods and I was entertained as well as amused.<br /><br />For all it's flaws, short-comings, it's lashings of cheesy clichés and predictable outcomes, I really enjoyed myself. The mutant killer primates are hilarious. And, then there's the mad professor who's totally lost the plot. His experiment has gone pear-shaped with disastrous consequences.

36641_0,"Oddly enough, this was the first Pink Panther film I ever saw. Thanks to its ""flashback"" scenes, I got interested in the PP series and eventually saw all the previous entries.<br /><br />Although this film was clearly a bad idea from the beginning, the first half actually isn't too bad. I didn't realize, until it was pointed out, that all of Sellers' scenes were deleted (or reused) footage from previous films. I had thought (like some other people who've commented) that Sellers had actually filmed scenes for this movie but died before finishing; that's testimony that Edwards actually did a pretty good job of incorporating old footage into a new story.<br /><br />Things start to go wrong when the Sellers footage runs out, at the moment Closeau's voice is dubbed in with the worst imitation imaginable. Soon almost all pretense of a plot is dropped. Now we get pointless interviews with past PP characters that comprise a tribute (often unbearably corny) to Closeau. He's discussed as if he's a movie character but the interviewees aren't; it all has nothing to do with how anyone would act if Closeau were real or any of the ""plot"" were actually happening. ""Flashback"" scenes are over-explained, and one in particular (involving Cato) comes so totally out of nowhere as to be confusing and disruptive. Finally, the scene with the ""grape treaders"" was totally unnecessary. (At least it was easily edited out for TV showings.)<br /><br />Not everything's bad, though. Herbert Lom is the best thing about this movie; he holds it together as well as could be expected. Showing scenes from Closeau's early life was a good idea, even if it wasn't carried out well. The part with the dog guiding the old woman is original and funny. At the end plot points are left unresolved all over the place, but that's OK because we're being set up for a sequel.<br /><br />One could say this movie shouldn't have been made. That's arguable, but it certainly could have been made better than it was."

Scott and Gordon look as if they are jumping around the screen.<br /><br />Dennis Weaver is hit by a bullet coming through a window.

36867_0,"Decidedly off-beat, farcial, incomprehensible story about Countess Dracula(an Elizabeth Bathory type that keeps young bathing in the blood of young, female virgins - or as she says ""wirgins"")and her two vampire sons who run a clothing story called Vamp and have enlisted the aid of a young, American professor of blood. While there is no denying that the film is really going for your funny bone rather than your jugular, much of the humour is hit and miss(mostly miss) akin to a nurse with poor eyesight trying to find a vein with a needle. Academy Award winning actress Louise Fletcher plays Mama Dracula with subtle humour, grace, and charm and looks quite stunning in much of the fashion, but she has virtually nothing to work with in this Belgian horror comedy that relies more on two vampire son boobs for much of the film's motivation. The Wajnberg brothers, Marc-Henri and Alexander, are two strange men indeed. They look quite ridiculous, act even more so, and, despite such elementary things as gaping and running about like two school children much of the time, have glimpses of talent. There is one scene with them doing a pantomime which I rather liked, but the story, the rest of the actors, the less than inspiring direction make this film a far more arduous thing to sit through. Much of the failure of the film must be squarely put on the shoulders of director Boris Szulzinger and his adolescent prowess at showing virtually nothing resembling horror. We see a quite impressive castle with impressive sets, but maybe total three shots of any blood at all - all nothing more than a prick-size bleed. No one is bit on stage so to speak. There are lots of girls showing us their breasts but no action otherwise. The humour is pretty stale stuff too. I like a good horror parody...OK, this is nothing like a good horror parody...but Mama Dracula just doesn't mange to do what a good horror parody does: blend comedy and horror together so as to create something that could be labeled as both legitimately. this film has only Dracula in the title and some scenarios that revolve around the concept of a bloodsucker - beyond that it is nothing more than a mild European sex comedy. Poor Louise Fletcher - she really does and did deserve more than this."
36911_0,"Let me start by saying this movie tries way too hard. What's with the long haired ghost and powder white boy at the start, who have nothing to do with the rest of the movie? I guess it's called pandering to the masses.<br /><br />But seriously, the scares keep coming and coming, but there's one problem. None of them are the least bit scary. Some are unintentionally hilarious, but nothing scary. Considering the greater part of the movie is supposed to be frightening, this is a major flaw.<br /><br />I don't particularly care about the characters either. Sure, they throw in some 5 minute subplots, but none are interesting. The plot is pretty basic as well. I mean, how original is a haunted theme park? There are some positives however. There are one or two death scenes, including a beheading, which are pretty cool. And they managed to find the official ugliest man in the world, who is fun to laugh at.<br /><br />Still, this movie isn't good. Pass it up for other better Asian ghost flicks.<br /><br />4/10"
36957_0,"The film opens with a song called ""Love Stinks"", that should be retitled ""This Film Stinks"", because it does, from director Robert Iscove (She's All That). Basically Ryan Walker and Jennifer Burrows met each other as youngsters on a plane, and seven years, they encounter each other again in UC Berkeley high school. Jennifer (Meet Joe Black's Claire Forlani) is quick, witty, ironic, literary and independent, and Ryan (I Know What You Did Last Summer's Freddie Prinze Jr.) is deliberate, literal, serious and studying structural engineering. They become best friends, consoling each other over break-ups, and Ryan shares his plans, Ryan's roommate Hunter/Steve (American Pie's Jason Biggs) is surprised they aren't getting together. Jennifer is going to Italy after graduation, and surprisingly they spend a night together, after which she skitters away saying they should just be friends, and he is withdrawing also. In the end though, very predictable, Ryan and Jennifer end up on the Italy plane together, and they do accept they love each other, while Hunter (in a small subplot) finds his perfect girl with Jennifer's friend Amy (Final Destination's Amanda Detmer). Also starring The Blair Witch Project's Heather Donahue as Megan and American Pie's Alyson Hannigan as Betty. Prinze Jr. is too good looking to be a nerd with glasses, Forlani is the wrong person for the character, and Biggs with his weird coloured hair is just too much like Jim with a tiny bit of Stifler added, and what was with that extra scene in the credits where he farts with some models?! Hardly funny and too predictable, it just doesn't have the same spark as something like American Pie. Pretty poor!"

That is exactly the way I felt. Many of these British comedies of the forties and fifties are remembered with fondness. By whom? This is just another example of an idyllic home-counties England run by an elite who can afford to indulge in puerile sports like racing veteran cars.

37046_0,"A huge, old-school operatic production mounted for the Mozart-partizan audience of Salzburg. As a dramatic, on-screen experience, it's pretty lame. This is partly to do with the music/singer-centric staging where design and dramatic detail are subordinate concerns. For example, the animals charmed by Tamino's first outing for the flute look like mangy, rejected extras from Planet of the Apes. Indeed, watching the opening 10 minutes without sound you would be forgiven for thinking you were watching a potted version of Wagner's Siegfried, so stock are the sets, costumes and blocking.<br /><br />The singing is fine, if a little indulgent. The filming is OK, with some good close-ups but the video director has his priority in validating the audience's exclusivity. There are shots of the auditorium not only during curtain calls but also during the performance itself. Essentially it's a document of a stage performance which loses almost everything as an artistic experience-in-itself by being brought to the screen. 3/10"

The behavior of Edward (Damian Young) after being tortured is reminiscent of Godard's acting; it cracks me up.<br /><br />However, I have to say this film is terrible for the following reasons: student film level of acting, full of meaningless dialogues (e.g. ""I'm sorry"" ""For what?"" ""I don't know""), and an abrupt ending. Please no more clichéd amnesia gimmick to make a plot. Please no more ""latest"" technology gadget--I'm talking about that pathetic floppy disk joke."

None of it is fully explained. However, unlike 2001 and Blair Witch 2, where some of the appeal comes from the unexplained, this movie is a confusing waste of time.<br /><br />We are given potentially interesting stuff that just sits there inert for the whole movie. Never once do we hear a basic explanation of the impact that bad dreams have on our life. And we'd like to. And what on earth does it have to do with the movie?

The characters are weak with no development and the acting is just embarrassing to watch. They barely have any scenes from the actual books and the legendary dark epic feel is completely lost. The character of Will was the young boy who found out he was endowed with magic before Harry Potter was even created and I'm sad to see them throw away these books with a quick production to try to catch the coattails of the Potter craze. (Don't get me wrong. I'm a big Harry Potter fan.) Even the special effects and visuals are poor and the editing is totally disjointed. Ugh, I can't even list all the problems with this movie. Even the camera work is sloppy and seems to be desperately trying to make something out nothing. Suffice it to say I have nothing really good to say about this movie at all. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing and it was quite painful. I hope Cooper allows another remake in the future. I'd love to see these books done properly."
37226_0,"I'm not one for horror movies, but I am one for a good mystery. From the advertisements, I thought this movie was going to be based on actual events of trying to capture an internationally notorious serial killer. The little bit of being ""not-human"" grabbed my attention furthermore, due to the idea that there really could be missing links in the evolutionary scale. Instead, I'm handed crap. My friend and I viewed possibly one of the worst movies ever, but unexpectedly hilarious. As well, how dare Hollywood Pictures have the gall to advertise a horror movie when it is a lame excuse of a somewhat political agenda. Yes, there is suffering in this world, but how dare the powers that be exploit such poverty with horrific humour. Sadly enough, I caught myself laughing at Orlando Jones' lines and the badly made CG deaths. If you dare see this B movie (maybe C or D), be sure to not watch the advertisements."

37316_0,"While it is not a complete ripoff of the Hollywood blockbuster from Farrelly brothers (There is Something about Mary), it is largely based on it. The whole Ompuri/Magic formula angle does not work and is totally unnecessary. However the biggest annoyance is Vivek Oberoi popping in and out at the narrator (played by the Farrelly brothers themselves in the original). Similar material would have been gold in Priyadarshan's hand. Akshay and Paresh Rawal are the only performers of any notice in the movie, rest of the cast is poor to average in terms of performance. Shahid Kapur was particularly disappointing playing the role Ben Stiller played in the original, no laughs for him at all!! Anu Malik is no longer the music director he once was a decade or so ago, he has not delivered a knockout soundtrack in ages. Overall it might be best to re-watch the original; a definite miss for everyone who is not a hard-core Akshay Kumar/Paresh Rawal comedy fan."

"" Sex and fury "" is so pale , unimaginative , restrained and melodramatic compared to them that it makes me sick to my stomach .

""Shark Attack"" is an unendurably stupid movie with no redeeming elements whatsoever: unoriginal plot, lame and overly fake action-sequences, no tension dull characters and  worst of all  absolutely no sense of humor! I usually like B-creature features but there's nothing as pathetic as an animals-revolting-violently-against-humans premise that takes itself too seriously! The completely untalented Casper Van Dien stars as a scientist (yeahhe sure looks like one) who travels to an African fishing town because the increasing amount of shark attacks there and one of the victims was his old high school buddy Marc. Upon arrival he discovers that another scientist is trying to genetically use the sharks for the developing of a cancer vaccine. Breeding sharks for medical reasons, hmm Now where have we seen that before? Oh yeah, Renny Harlin did the same with his ""Deep Blue Sea"" and that wasn't a very good film neither! Some of the dialogues are so bad they hurt your ears and the acting is really lousy. There's no horror here, neither, unless you consider the dissection of several shark-cadavers to be grueling. The James-Bond style climax is ridiculous and the concluding moral of the film is that animals can't be mean-spirited by naturehumans always the evil driving force behind everything. Yawn! Better watch ""Jaws"" again, even though it's for the 200th time."

37677_0,"Spending last night drafting my review of ""Lord Of War"" (only watched it the night before) and not really getting anywhere, I was distracted by the BBC who occasionally broadcast films that I have never heard of but still persuade me to watch. Sometimes, this can backfire as anyone who watched ""The Ghost"" will tell you but given that this film had several actors of note, I figured I'd forget about Nicolas Cage (momentarily) and instead focus on this strange mix of supernatural mystery and courtroom drama.<br /><br />Sienna Guillory plays Julie, a young au pair working in Italy and still traumatised by the death of her mother in a fire when she was 15. Despite this, she works for a middle-aged couple (Derek de Lint and Alice Krige) looking after their infant child but before long, tragedy strikes when the baby is also killed in a fire. Accused of murder, Julie finds herself defended by Antonio Gabrieli (Mark Strong) but soon, it looks like there are far darker motives at heart than petty jealousy.<br /><br />Despite being described as a ""supernatural thriller"" by the BBC, this was about as thrilling as watching grass grow. It never really got going and even though the impressive cast do well with a patchy script, you never really believe it because it's clearly bunkum. Take the actors - with the exception of Ms Guillory, every other character is supposed to be Italian but there is no way you'd know that watching it. The most European actor on set is Charlotte Rampling as a strange psychotherapist-slash-nun (some mistake, surely) who gets involved in the case. One other thing I really didn't like was the fact that the script obviously favoured the supernatural approach over a straight-forward murder - close-up shots of ravens, fog floating on the surface of a lake and other stereotypical images gave the game away pretty quickly. Nothing wrong with being ""alternative"" but at no point was the murder explained beyond some seriously dodgy nonsense about poltergeists and psychic powers. I've seen episodes of ""The X Files"" that were more of a ""supernatural thriller"" than this.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film is filled with a strong cast, most of whom actually perform very well. Guillory is impressive as the tortured teenager and so is Strong, who I've only ever seen in one-off TV dramas on ITV (which is not normally a ringing endorsement of one's acting credentials). Both have adequate support from Francis Barber and a cameo from David Warner but given that everyone is supposed to be Italian, what's the point of these fine British actors being there? In fact, why set it in Italy at all - the film would work just as fine if it were set in Britain. It's symptomatic of a film that has plenty of ideas and heavyweight actors but little cohesion, imagination or enthusiasm. Personally, I'd rather watch something like ""The Craft"" or something with a bit of life in it. But I'm afraid ""Superstition"" hasn't much going for it. I knew there was a reason I'd never heard of it..."

Photographed by A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Jacques Haitkin through layers of murk designed to conceal a multitude of budgetary deficiencies, and 'distinguished' by flashy editing and gymnastic camera-work designed to conceal the lack of a comprehensible plot, Tony Randel's unconvincing future noir trades the visionary outlook of the original graphic novel for the same lumbering, humorless approach which typified this particular subgenre before US producers *finally* learned how to imitate their Asian counterparts. Though brutal in places, particularly during the final confrontation between Daniels and Mandylor, the film actually *downplays* the gory carnage of its source material, which will disappoint those expecting a more faithful adaptation. <br /><br />A popular figure in this kind of DTV potboiler, Daniels was clearly hired for his fighting skills rather than his acting, and he's upstaged throughout by many of his co-stars (including Chris Penn, Melvin Van Peebles and Malcolm McDowell). Thankfully, Randel makes a virtue of Daniels' handsome face and muscular torso, and there's an unmistakable whiff of homoerotic tension in the aggressive relationship between Daniels and his equally handsome nemesis."

Pretty boys traipse through this would-be drama that adopts the viewpoint of a petulant, oblivious, vain, homosexual snob away at school in Jolly Old. The twee goings-on advance the preposterous premise that Guy Bennett (based on Guy Burgess) went Commie because he was gay, and was thrown out of school before he got to wear his foppish upper-classmen vest. Oh brother! ...oh, and he received a caning once. He was OK with the canings others received as a routine part of the English school system, but HIS caning hurt. This is roughly analogous to saying Guy Bennett became a roadside bandit, a pirate, or an evil scientist because he had a bad experience at Cambridge. Yeah, everyone has a bad experience at Cambridge. As depicted here, Bennett becoming a Communist in response to his social structure is as likely as Martha Stewart becoming a Sumo wrestler after she burnt a soufflé.

However, when she claims to be attacked several times, the police and her doctor start to wonder if she is imagining it. We eventually find out that she has some lurid family history, but we never really know what is real or imagined. The movie is mostly told from Ingrid's point of view, which proves unreliable. She eventually commits suicide and we find out some more of her past, ending with an ambiguous final shot.<br /><br />I didn't really find the movie atmospheric or involving. It had a low-budget feel and looks to be marketed as a trashy thriller, but it could have been a TV movie considering the content. Nothing really stood out, not much was memorable.<br /><br />Some recommendations: If you are interested in a movie with similar themes but want more something that will make more of an impact, try ""Chinatown,"" ""The Grifters,"" or ""Angels and Insects."""

A lot of times you can find out just how good a singer is when you hear them in person, instead of the studio making them sound perfect.<br /><br />I found out Nicks isn't that good a singer as she sounds on disc. What's more, I was totally turned off and disgusted she resorted to profanity in a couple of her songs, even saying ""G- damn"" in one of them.

Anyway, her raspy voice sounded poor and this was not an impressive concert.<br /><br />I thought it might be fun to see and hear Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton, who are billed as guest stars, but they just played backup and didn't have much of a role in here. There are 14 songs in all, the best one being the finale although part of it is just her shaking hands with people in the audience.<br /><br />For a beautiful setting like Red Rocks, I thought the lighting was just so-so, not as dynamic as it good have been, sort of like Nick's performance."

There's an excellent cast, great music, stunning cinematography, terrific production design ... all the ingredients are there, but it never came alive for me.<br /><br />The performances are so understated that the characters have no definition. Kristofferson plays Billy the Kid and James Coburn his friend turned nemesis, Sheriff Pat Garrett. It takes two hours for Garrett and Billy to have their final showdown; in the process they drift languidly through one laconic scene after another. There's a fair amount of gunplay, with the by now banal slow motion deaths, but even the action sequences lack fire.<br /><br />This is ultimately a meditative, brooding film, which is probably the idea; but it's just too plodding for my taste.<br /><br />One trivial gripe: whatever they used for blood in this picture struck me as some of the fakiest I've ever seen.

They just all seem to be way too dramatic, and you get the sense they're acting like they know they're in a horror film (if that's what you want to call it) and are acting out the cliché reactions. Mary herself was not scary, but probably more cute and cuddly. Seriously, I felt when she came on screen she was the fairy good witch, not scary at all.

I was never sure how much time had passed or how all the random people kept showing up. And because there were so many randoms in this movie it made it hard to even follow who some of the main characters were (i.e. Amber). The supposed ""good guy"" was almost as much of a douche as Derrick (up until the point that Derrick kills the girl). Also, if you're fighting for survival in a world overrun by zombies (and in a supposed nuclear fallout - or something quite similar), why would you let such a terrible person stay in your midst? Anyhow. This movie was terrible, and I only finished watching it out of pure fascination as to how it is possible to make such a terrible movie, even on such a low budget - which is no excuse, just to let you know.<br /><br />A cheesy movie is acceptable when done right - this wasn't.<br /><br />If you're going to watch this movie, be prepared for the worst cinematic adventure of your life.<br /><br />PS, I agree that this should be called an F Movie instead of a B Movie, and should not even get the good graces of a 1, for it was far more terrible than that. Also, there should never be a sequel to this atrocity.<br /><br />Thank you, and good night."
38171_0,"This film is very entertaining but simply never makes any sense--like the studio hired monkeys to write much of the film. The story begins with Mae Clark and her accomplice conning some department stores out of money. However, when Clark is eventually caught (and rightfully so--she is after all a thief), she vows to destroy a man who worked for a department store that insisted she be prosecuted (Ralph Bellamy). So, as she sits in jail she spends all her energy thinking about how to hurt this one particular man--which makes no sense since they never even met in the film. Why she should hate this particular man and not the judge or prosecuting attorney or her accomplice (who pushed her into a life of crime)? And, what makes even less sense is that her plot is then so complicated! This just didn't make sense and made me a bit annoyed. After all, there were some good story elements and good actors but the plot just seemed 100% contrived.<br /><br />Here is the crazy plot. Once Clark gets out of jail, she meets Bellamy and gets him drunk. Then, she produces a fake marriage certificate the next morning--which complicates his life, as he already is married--to a lady that Clark met while in prison!!! Wow, the odds of this are 68 bazillion to one! So, to avoid being arrested for bigamy, he agrees to let her lead him around by the nose and make him 100% miserable. Why didn't he immediately go to the police and report the blackmail? This is especially true since being drunk is a legitimate reason to nullify the wedding--at which point they would have found out that the new wedding was a hoax. I just hate films where people do things that no logical or reasonable person would have done. Again and again, both Clark and Bellamy react in the least logical manner imaginable. The worst is a bit later when Clark is caught committing another crime and Bellamy could have just let the police take her away--yet he vouches for her and prevents her arrest!! And, sadly, although she is evil, you KNOW that by the end of the film everything will work out perfectly--making it predictable and very formulaic. How such a cretin like Clark could become a good and decent lady by the end of the film makes no sense--especially since she worked so long and so hard to destroy Bellamy!! This all is a shame. As I said, the actors were good and with a Pre-Code title like ""Parole Girl"" you'd expect a lot more pizazz and fireworks--not a contrived and limp story like this one.<br /><br />Despite disliking much of the film, I did like the character played by Bellamy's boss. He was a great character--well acted and fascinatingly different. He was a wonderful addition to the film and perhaps this represents a portion of the film NOT written by the monkeys!!"
38216_0,"I've seen all that's in this movie once before. Matrix-hitech, Sliver-watching, BladeRunner-lighteffects, Seven-atmosphere. But few effects and clearly 0.0 CGI included. Weird characters that don't interest or appeal to me. The why/who/when/where part stays unclear. It's an art-house kind of movie with a few familiar faces.<br /><br />Not easy to follow, and no block-buster-kind of movie that everyone will (or can) enjoy. Was there a plot anyway, one should ask himself after watching. The box-plot sounds interesting, but never becomes interesting. Any suspense? Yeah, in the soundtrack. Keep your skip-button within reach. * out of *****"
38261_0,Not even Evil Deads' Sam Raimi could help this pitiful excuse for a spaghetti Western. Sharon Stone comes back to seek revenge years after the death of her father. Gene Hackman seems to be the only one not going through the motions and actually giving us a decent performance. However the script written by Simon Moore is so incoherent and dull. The characters are characters you've seen in every revenge movie ever. But Sam is a bit to blame as well. Holes in heads big enough to see the person who put them there and people doing backflips after getting shot were just a few of the very unbelievable things in this movie. Sam should just stick to Spider-Man.
38306_0,"When I saw Quentin Tarantino`s and Robert Rodriguez`s From Dusk Till Dawn I was around 12 years old. And even today I think that that movie is one off the coolest ever made.<br /><br />But in 1999 I rented From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money, Directed by Scott Spiegel and written by Scott Spiegel and Actor/writer Duane Withaker.<br /><br />The first film is so cool because the first half is a gangster film, and then it just changes into a vampire film. This sequel also tries to do the same thing. But it fails.<br /><br />The original had George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Danny Trejo, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Salma Hayek. The most knows actor in this film is Robert Patrick from The X-files. Also the crew is nothing like the original. Tarantino and Rodriguez is Exec. porudcers, but nothing more. The man at the helm is Spiegel most known for....well nothing.<br /><br />The SFX? THERE IS NO SFX. I mean the blood is so bad in the film, the could just as well used red paint.<br /><br />The direction is some of the worst I`ve ever seen. The camera angels is so f***ed up. They have placed the camera inside the mouth off a vamp. The script is so bad that I laugh out loud. Some of the dialouge is so bad, it coould be of been written by a ten year old.<br /><br />I mean really what can you expect from a film where the main cast consists of Robert patrick and Raimond Cruz?<br /><br />0/5 - Stay away!!!!!!!!"
38351_0,"This filmed sucked from the start. Its just as well the guy in command at the beginning of the film got shot coz his accent was so indescribable and annoying. And what chances did they have with a dim wit medic like that. Who ever did the music hadn't a clue, especially when Mr Madsen appears and its some sleazy late night bar jazz music going on and as for the lame rock music in parts..well not exactly on a 1940's theme are they. I can understand the makers were trying to be funny but it was as funny as dying of dysentery in a muddy trench. Also were the black & white cut scenes really necessary. Yes war really did happen. In fact they were probably more interesting than the rest of the film. For the few good actors it starred it could have been a great film but alas the script was weak. Worst war film I've watched since 'We were Soldiers'. Madsen was in it purely to boost the sales. I feel raped of my time watching this. Harsh I know but what a disappointment. Give me Kelly Heroes any day."
38397_0,"At least some bad movies have *something* in them that you can talk or laugh about after the fact. Some are so bad they are funny. Not Futureworld, my nominee for the worst movie of all time. I challenge you to find me a worse movie. Watching this was agony. I know its a rare sequel that matches anything like its precursor, but man, they could have copied a little of the first one--even a sex scene for cryin' out loud. It's been over 20 years, but the taste in my mouth is still bad."
38441_0,"Somewhere at the core of Horsemen there is a good idea and a riveting premise. The execution, however, is all style and too little substance. There may have been a great screenplay at the beginning of the development of this project, but if there was, it got into the wrong hands along the way. The end product is a mess, like Frankenstein's monster, as if it were pieced together from material from past, better films. <br /><br />Every single ""serial killer on the loose"" movie cliché is lined up, making Horsemen a tribute to these flicks or a ""best of"" compilation at best and a sad copy at worst. There is a neat twist almost half way through that cannot be described without spoiling the central premise, the only truly interesting part in the film, but in the end nothing remotely remarkable is done with it. <br /><br />I am very sure that the people at Platinum Dunes are very good at what they do and they consciously aim their releases at a specific genre audience and most of their films are a success in that respect (I liked the raw energy of the Friday the 13th remake) but Horsemen is a failure of diabolical proportions. Dennis Quaid looks like he's sleepwalking through his role and his character is ridiculously clichéd. The rest of the cast cannot really do anything with their roles either, their characters being sketches at most  there is not one credible personality in this film's universe. <br /><br />Photography is great, though: the film looks slick  just like an episode of CSI. The similarities do not end there; there are even a couple of those CGI zooms into wounds accompanied by a metallic sound. In fact, the whole film reminds me of an episode of a Bruckheimer TV procedural, only somewhat more gruesome. <br /><br />Thankfully brief, Horsemen clocks in at a mere 80 minutes, but there isn't a single memorable moment in the entire experience. The ""message"" or ""controlling idea"" in the end ultimately turns out to be pretentious and very shallow. This idea could have been worth a much better execution  no pun intended."

It is one of the worst i have ever seen, next to ""Troll 2"" (that might even be better). I could barely make it through. The directing was awful, the storyline is SO awful, characters are 2d, special effects are worthless. It was so bad, i wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. The story is about a Nerdy boy who lives with his Christian ""mommy"", who gets picked on at school by bullies in the bathroom. They spend a lot of time in that bathroom it seems. The cousin of this infamous nerd is a bad ass motor cycle riding 80's boy toy who's reckless with the ""babes"". They all seem to tamper with this phone-line 976-evil, that tempts them into doing naughty things, via ""satan"". After some time, the main character (nerd), gets obsessed and the evil takes him over. Wow. Then the tension builds!...He goes on a minor rampage taking foes out. I wouldn't want to spoil the terrific ending in case your tempted to see this (note the sarcasm). If i could rate this below a 1, i would.<br /><br />It is a waste of anyone's time.

38577_0,"Oh, c'mon, everybody, where is the love? First of all, when you slide some title off the shelf that never made it to theatrical release with a cover that features Dennis Hopper staring out at you in all his squinty-eyed, slightly soulful I-Am-a-Raving-Lunatic intensity. . .brace yourself for the possibility that you may be making a terrible mistake.<br /><br />Since the plot and writing credits have been hashed out already, I wont go into them, except to say I haven't seen so many people frothing at the mouth over a movie since they announced Michael Keaton was playing BATMAN way back in 1989.<br /><br />Sure very little of it made any sense, but was it fun watching Dennis Hopper rip his own face off? Sure! There was a pretty woman for the men to look at, a hunky guy for the ladies to look at, a decent cast, sadistic prison guards, a crazed warden, bogus science, a corrupt politician, a real electric chair, an autopsy, brain maggots, falling brains. . .my gosh. Fun galore on an evening when you've got nothing better to do. Are these my standards for great movies? No, but I didn't rent this title to see a great movie, or even a good movie.

38621_0,"I get it, I really do. What is not to get? This show is a sketch show that attempts to parody local public access and cable TV. Tim and Eric go out of their way to ""appear"" to be incompetent, bumbling fools. OK, message received. But that is all you get. 4 seasons (and counting for some unknowable reason) of awkward silence, broken by miscues and babbling incoherence. And vomit. Lots and lots of vomit. Drippling down chins, or being propelled across the room. And don't forget the homo-erotic overtones, which I am quite fine with by the way. The problem I have with their treatment of it is that it is in no way funny. Instead it becomes awkward and painful to watch. They are not laughing AT homosexuals, and they are not laughing WITH them either. In fact on one is laughing at all. <br /><br />I loved Mr. Show, Bob Odenkirk, and David Cross. I like everything these two fine comedians have ever done. Which is why I am baffled that Mr. Odenkirk would let his name, and face, be associated with this monotonous drivel. His appearances certainly do stand out against the backdrop of failure. But to compare this show to Mr. Show is a stinging slap in the face of true comedy."

38711_0,"I wonder why this film has a 6.0 rating on IMDb. Is it possible people saw this bad film and actually thought it was good?! The world is a strange place, indeed.<br /><br />Now I started watching this film strongly predisposed to liking it. After all, I adore the Universal horror films of the 30s and 40s and the Invisible Man series is among the best. Plus, the idea of the Allies using the invisibility formula to infiltrate Nazi territory to do some spying is an inspired plot idea. Yet, almost miraculously, the Universal folks produced a very bad film.<br /><br />Most of the problem is that unlike most other horror films of the time, this one was very often played for laughs. Considering that the guy is supposed to get important information and get out, his sticking around to play tricks on the incredibly stupid Nazis was really dumb--and not in a good way! Plus, after a while, it was obvious that there was an invisible guy running about--talk about a great way to maintain your cover! Additionally, instead of the usual conniving and evil Nazis like you'd see in an American wartime propaganda film, here they are complete morons--almost like what you'd see in a Three Stooges film. If it were a Stooges film that would be great...but not in a horror film. Making it a straight drama would have improved the film tremendously.<br /><br />Additionally, it's obvious Universal simply didn't care when they made this film. Even for a B-movie, it is cheap and has a slapped together look. The models used for airplanes for the film were pathetically unrealistic and it was obvious they were bad models. Also, having Peter Lorre (whose heritage in reality was German) playing a Japanese man was ridiculous. In fact, it wasn't until later in the film that you even realized he was supposed to be Japanese! Now I understand that Lorre played the lead in the Mr. Moto films (where he was supposed to be Japanese), but here he didn't even try to look or sound Asian. Mantan Moreland would have been just as fitting an actor to play this role. Finally, throw in an unimportant and ridiculous love story that comes out of no where and you have the ingredients for a truly awful film.<br /><br />Exceptionally poor writing, indifferent direction and actors who couldn't have possibly made this material work and you have INVISIBLE AGENT in a nut shell. Don't say I didn't warn you! Fortunately, the next film in the series (THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE) is quite a bit better."
38757_0,"One of the things that supposedly led Jeremy Brett to take on the mantle of Holmes was the fact that Granada wanted to do something that no other film or television producer had done before, namely, do the Doyle stories as they were written. And for the most part, they did. It seems that towards the end of Brett's life, when he was at his weakest, they gave him the weirdest, melodramatic and nonsensical adaptations to showcase his talents. Even if I didn't know the story The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor, ""The Eligible Bachelor"" would've had me confused, since it is just all over the place. We start out with the upcoming nuptials of Hattie Doran and Lord Robert St. Simon (along the lines of the original story). Then we veer into a very strange subplot with Sherlock Holmes being unable to sleep because he's having a recurring nightmare (which he sketches). Throw in an old estate with jungle animals, a maimed veiled lady (possibly borrowed from The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger)a murderous husband, a wife driven mad and all other sorts of wackiness that not only was never in the original story, but which just makes the whole piece unwieldy and a mess. I've appreciated other episodes where the writers were able to dramatize some elements of ""backstory"" but in this case, they just added in all sorts of things that made for an over-the-top piece of melodrama that probably has Conan Doyle spinning."
38801_0,"The original exploitation classic-though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people. The cats can't get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners. Poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970's. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but is so lovable a person (I generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks) that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out. Mikels wanted to make films and he didn't care how they turned out so long as he was producing something. More power to him, but I wish he wouldn't subject us to the ones that are little more than his home movies"
38847_0,"The DVD is in B & W. Remastered but lacks any depth --- still looks old. Set in the 1800s the ""Dance Master"" does a lot of 1930 style tap dancing. Frank Morgan is funny but the rest is almost a waste of time. The whole problem with the culture and his teaching WALTZ dancing was how putting his right hand on the lady was an offense. I can't tell if this was for the 1936 audience or part of the 1800s culture. A few times a Mexican band played a few bars of Malaguena and then mixed it in with some other music style. Plot holes--The main character was kidnapped and forced to work on a pirate ship. Then he is let loose on land-the map shows LOS ANGELES; but he is clearly in Mexico... The map shows California is a state although in the 1800s; I believe the map is wrong for that era. Then when he is walking into town; the pirate ship leaves him--there is no explanation at all...."
38892_0,"I'm glad to see that IMDb users were not fooled by Almereyda's ultimately empty, though pretty, adaptation of Hamlet. In reading press for the film, visions of mass delusions and payola danced through my head. This is a lush, beautifully paced film that fails miserably, because the director forgot that you must make a movie do more than look good.<br /><br />I've read that the director did copious research on the play, watching other adaptations, etc. before embarking on his own journey. Apparently he didn't watch closely enough. His script relies heavily on a viewer already familiar with the play, and cuts or rearranges some of the most important scenes. The bulk of the scene between Polonius and Hamlet which begins with Hamlet calling the elder a fishmonger is gone. The final scene is so chopped up to fit Almereyda's modern conceits that it is virtually unrecognizable. That scene is also hastily and sloppily filmed. When does the King poison the wine? A viewer who does not already know that it is poisoned is lost. As was this production.<br /><br />Problems with Almereyda's ham-handed script and spotty direction aside, the real problem here can be reduced to three words: acting, acting, acting. I haven't seen Shakespeare handled this badly since high school. Kyle MacLachlan shines above the rest in his role, and Diane Venora and Leif Schreiber are passable and sometimes even good in their roles. Steve Zahn appears to have the best handle on how to effectively play Rosencrantz as a modern day drinkin' bud, but unfortunately Almereyda has cut most of his role. But aside from them, much of the rest is embarassing and laughable. Julia Stiles comes off as a rank amateur; the cringe factor in her readings is off the meter. The coup de grace is the scene when she fully goes mad and goes cross-eyed as she's flinging polaroids about. She looks more like she's trying to approach a slapstick approximation of drunkenness than a despair-filled descent into madness. Bill Murray, who I love, and who I think is one of the most underrated actors around, is completely out of his depth. Afraid that by playing Polonius too funny, people will accuse him of putting his ""stamp"" on it, he plays it dry and manages to rip all the laughs out of the funniest character in the play. Polonius is a clown, and should be played as such. Ian Holm's definitive performance in the less-than-definitive Mel Gibson Hamlet is the high watermark, and Holm plays him like a proper court jester. Even Sam Shepard seems a little lost. Granted, Shakespeare isn't really his area of theater, but one would have thought he'd have a better handle on it. And then we come to Ethan Hawke, who I generally think is a very talented actor as well. But his sullen, brooding Hamlet is a one-note prince, and a pretty tedious note at that. While the much-talked about To be or not to be speech is wonderfully conceived in that monument of indecision, Blockbuster, with the not-too-subtle ""Action"" signs passing by our mirthless heir, Hawke reads the speech without ever getting out of first gear, without ever giving a hint of meaningful inflection. In my Brit.Lit. class in high school we had to memorize and recite this monologue...there were better readings in my class than Hawke offers up here, and his entire performance pretty much follows suit. His jovial, consoling advice to Ophelia to ""get thee to a nunnery"" is laughable, and while he hits the right note in the also well-conceived, but displaced finish to the scene, leaving the rest of the speech on her answering machine, we're still so busy laughing that the rage loses it's power.<br /><br />This Hamlet is style lacking substance, as Almereyda tries to bind the limitless space of Shakespeare's text within a nutshell, only to find that there's nothing left inside when he's done."
38937_0,"I always try to support or fight for low budget or independent film and from what I understand this is a low budget one, and for that it should be commended. To be fair it's not overly obvious that money was tight. However that's not the reason I didn't like this film.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell is troubled teenager fresh out of rehab rejoins family in a new town. Cue an urban legend about a school bus stopping on the railroad tracks and a train smashing into it and killing all involved. Legend has it that if you put your car in neutral on the tracks the ghosts of the dead children will move your car off leaving behind fingerprints that you can see if you cover your car with talc beforehand.......yawn! Then there's a twist that's so blatant you want to shout at the scriptwriter, and a dark figure killing people all of a sudden. So there's nothing original in the story, it's cliché ridden, but acted okay...so far so average.<br /><br />The problem I had with the film was there wasn't a nice person in it, I couldn't have cared less about any of them including the heroine. I found myself refusing to give up on the film in case some good came of it, but desperately clock watching and wishing it would finish. It drags, it treats you like you're stupid, and you want them all to die.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it but it's not bad enough to say avoid like the plague."

This was enough !!! Was this a movie from the early 80's , CAN'T BE, I THOUGHT. It seems it was more a movie from the early 50's or 60's. By the way, it's more like a humor-movie.

39026_0,"I have seen this movie 5 or 6 times over the past 10 years or so - whenever Scifi Channel plays it pretty much. I have to say that this movie is just awful but it is thoroughly entertaining. In that regard I love it. To give an analogy, this would be like making a movie yourself. It won't be that great but you will love watching it nonetheless... The Howling V is full of cheesy acting and has cheesy plot, if any, but there are some good scary moments. The set and lighting, while not thoroughly professional looking, are good indeed and do help to make the movie as good as it is.<br /><br />All things being equal, this movie sucks, but, is worth a whirl in the VCR."
39071_0,"I will keep this short and sour. I'd like to get into the sheer horrors that this movie lays out there, but there is a one thousand word maximum, so that would be impossible.<br /><br />First of all, any effort to make exposition any less painful than it became was clearly abandoned in the early stages of the writing process and replaced with painful ""into the camera"" sequences. Not only does this device show an astonishing lack of creativity, but it also grates on your nerves after an hour and a half. I'm not saying I expected this film to be some fine accomplishment of cinema. Or even less than a total embarrassment for everyone involved, including the viewer, but to unleash this on an unsuspecting public is just cruel.<br /><br />On a totally superficial side note... How short is Christian Slater? I never thought him to be a tall man, but unless everyone else in the film is roughly the size if Shaquille O'Neal, Mr. Slater should inquire about membership to the lollipop guild."
39116_0,"This film had so much potential, but just didn't get it done.<br /><br />The first, really glaring problem is the opening that has a very incomplete and poorly-explained history of how the Khmer Rouge came to power. I found it confusing, and I know the history. They make the mistake of assuming people already know what happened there.<br /><br />S21 has such a horrifying history, a place where humanity reached its nadir, but the film really just scratches the surface.<br /><br />One angle that goes almost completely unexplored is the loss/lack of humanity on both sides. The destruction of the prisoners is well-covered, but the guards are given a mostly one-dimensional role, and their own situation is barely considered, aside from overly long reenactments of how they would conduct themselves toward the prisoners.<br /><br />Vann Nath, one of the few survivors of S21, talks to the guards who are pretty close-mouthed and unwilling/unable to defend themselves. One should remember that they were largely 12 or 13 year-olds, selected at that age because they could be easily manipulated and indoctrinated, or they did what they did because they feared for their own lives. Seeing a survivor talk to the guards is very interesting, but they also needed someone neutral, as Vann has no patience for their explanations. Vann laments the loss of humanity of the prisoners, but does not consider that it existed on both sides.<br /><br />Many of the things the guards did would be so anathema to human nature, be so morally repugnant, that I don't think (or like to believe) that most people would do them unless they fear for their lives, or could not really grasp what they were doing.<br /><br />Granted, many Khmer Rouge knew exactly what was going on, and they condoned torture and murder. If one ever goes to S21 and sees the mug shots on the wall, with men, women, children, even infants looking back at you with heartbreaking fear and hopelessness, you cannot help but hate those who killed them. But, if this film also looked at those who did it and why, it would have been much more effective.<br /><br />On the whole, it's a very disappointing experience. There's so much to talk about, and more horror than you can really wrap your mind around, but the film doesn't help you appreciate this."
39161_0,"I agree with the previous reviewers who noted that the premise of C.H.U.D. is much better than the execution. The idea of radiation in the subways turning homeless folks into cannibalistic monsters is awesome. And I liked the cop searching for his wife, the photographer doing a story on vagrants, the crazy soup kitchen dude, etc. Unfortunately, the script is seriously underwritten and the characters are not sufficiently fleshed out, neither are the situations. To me, the film deserved a more gritty, less cheesey (i.e., fake gore and goofy looking monsters) approach, with a more visually gifted director (David Fincher perhaps?) and better actors than John Heard and Daniel Stern (who aren't bad, by the way.) See Alligator (1980) as an example of a movie like this that is done well. I give C.H.U.D. 4/10. (One extra star for the title.)"
39206_0,"My Take: Good-looking and well-cast, but utterly tedious. <br /><br />I haven't read the book yet, and this is the only version of the novel that I have seen. This adaptation has its moments, but apparently too few than one might expect. Burt Lancaster delivers a wonderful performance, and so does the rest of the cast, but the film lags a bit too long. The make-up job on Richard Basehart and the other creatures are excellent, but doesn't show much to save some rather unimpressive moments.<br /><br />I'm sure H.G. Wells wouldn't roll on his grave with this since it is wonderfully fashioned, but it definitely not a classic like the first one, ""The Island of Lost Souls"", has become, but definitely worth a look for some fine performances, exotic locations and fine creature make-up. Also for those most in need of nap. <br /><br />Rating: ** out of 5."
39251_0,"I realize that a lot of people actually enjoyed ""Double Team"", that its director Tsui Hark is a talented and hard working fellow responsible for some outstanding Hong Kong cinema in years past, and that Jean Claude Van Damme has at least managed to stay pretty buff even as his career declined (unlike his contemporary Steven ""Make Mine KFC"" Seagal). <br /><br />But ""Double Team"" sounded the Death Knell for Van Damme's movie career, which was finished off and consigned to direct-to-video Hell by Hark's follow up ""Knock Off"" in 1998. (Although I felt that ""Knock Off was mildly enjoyable, Hark's off-kilter approach and the 3rd rate screenplay made it tank big-time with American audiences). <br /><br />It's not that the movie itself was all that bad to look at.It's obviously the work of professionals. The hyper-kinetic camera work and meth-driven action sequences are pretty much what we've come to expect from Hark and his colleagues, there's some reasonably witty give and take in the dialog, a few decent one liners, etc., the actors are reasonably buff, etc. I tried to take all this into account, and all these mitigating elements help a little, but in the end, ""Double Team"" is obviously the Beginning Of The End. <br /><br />Why?? Well, we've always known the Van Damme isn't an Actor, he's a Body (like, say, Marc Singer in ""Beast Master""). He's only believable in a limited range of roles, and he's very limited in his dramatic range of emotions ( the thick accent has always been a hindrance ). And ""Double Team"" pretty much signaled that Hollywood had run out of things to do with him, that his fan base and audience was pretty much played out, and that every VD film from now on would be a retread or a derivative, 2nd rate mishegoss. Three major directors had made a shot at bringing him into the mainstream (""Hard Target"", ""Time Cop"", and ""Sudden Death""), and Van Damme had been decent-to-excellent in all of them...but all those directors had moved on and Van Damme was now back to making ""B"" movie fodder. <br /><br />Or in the case of ""Double Team"" a 'freak show buddy movie' whose gimmick was that it starred Dennis Rodman as a giant Dennis Rodman. Rodman's whole gimmick as a celebrity (as opposed to his inarguable talent as a pro basketball player) is that he is ""outrageous"", and the movie stops repeatedly to let him BE outrageous, with various hi tech gimmicks and basketball-themed weapons that seemed to have been invented by your ninth-grade nephew. There are some potentially funny and incisive lines , but the delivery (by both Van Damme and Rodman) pretty much just lies there. Van Damme is particularly ""off"" in this movie, like he's just going through the motions until his hangover subsides or something. <br /><br />So it's not a ""real"" movie, but just a strung together series of set pieces with testosterone-fueled muscle flexing and an almost complete lack of actual human emotion or feeling. Oh, a certain kind of audience will love this kind of thing, but somehow, this particular movie seemed to permanently typecast Van Damme as a 2nd rater, a hack actor in the same vein as Rutger Hauer, Dolph Lundgren and, yes, Steven Seagal...All these actors also started off with a big splash in well designed vehicles that showcased their talents...and then faded into B-to-Z movie hackdom as the casting agencies and action directors moved on to other, fresher faces. <br /><br />For all his limitations as an actor and an action star, I've always enjoyed Van Damme - he's good looking, he is capable of mild wit and self deprecating humor, and he works hard at maintaining his physique in a career phase where a lot of his action star peers from the same period have let themselves go and have to suck their guts in and hope for a good camera angle. I was sad to see him going through the motions in this silly half-baked excuse for a screenplay."
39297_0,"when people ask you about Christmas films, what do bring up? The Grinch, the Rankin-Bass stuff, a Christmas carol, Santa clause 3? this is obviously the most boring film i ever saw (folowing Bee movie and Pinocchio 3000). the series is about adding laws to Santa Claus (exciting enough!) this one adds in Jack frost (played by Martin short) trying to take Santa's place. he does this using the ""escape Clause"". how does it work? simply make Santa touch a snowglobe and say ""i wish i was never Santa"". what makes a film worse than a boring story? actors who don't give a $#!t. Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, everybody loves Raymond) died after this movie! P.S i recommend Scrooged over this! (every one would)"
39341_0,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why did Dennis Quaid star in this? I picked this one up at the Redbox. I misread the plot. I thought it was about 4 people who had one thing in common, they were all the bringers of the apocalypse. I thought they were the 4 Horsemen. Instead, we get a cheap rip off of 7even. It tries so hard to be suspenseful, scary, creepy, etc. The movie was very boring. I wasn't the slightest bit thrilled or given the creeps. The movie is basically about 4 serial killers who base their killings off the 4 Horsemen of the apocalypse in the bible. The serial killers kill their victims by suspending them in the air with hooks digging into their backs. The more they squirm, the more they bleed. The even post it on the internet where supposedly, millions of teenage serial killers are watching. This is a rip-off of FearDotCom and another film which I can't think of the name right now.<br /><br />There are plenty of plot holes and problems in this film. I would strongly recommend you avoid this part if you don't want to be spoiled: <br /><br />1. Alex's Bedroom: Late into the film, Aidan enters his son's bedroom and finds white paint everywhere! Alex has been painting his room white for 3 years. His father hasn't been in his Alex's room for 3 years. This is stupid. Wouldn't Sean, the younger brother or Aidan smell the fumes coming from the paint from Alex's bedroom? Everything in his room has been painted. His bed, pillow, sheets, walls, ceiling, floor, possessions, computer, etc. Everything has been painted white! Wouldn't Aidan or Sean notice the smell of new or fresh paint coming from Alex's bedroom? Big, BIG plot hole! Also, wouldn't Alex have been so sick to the point that the poor kid is bedridden. He hasn't been that sick in 3 years? No colds, flues, food poisoning, etc? I usually get colds about once or twice a year.<br /><br />2. The 4 Suspension Rigs: The suspension rigs are about the size of my bed. It is a queen size bed. These rigs would be pretty suspicious if a bunch of teenagers were buying them. Wouldn't somebody notice these kids unloading these things and putting them into abandoned buildings? Also, when the cops go to the store where they bought them, the owner of the store says he's only sold 4 of them to a bunch of teenagers. Yet, the store owner doesn't act suspicious or anything! What do 4 teenagers need 4 suspension rigs for? Why not just buy one and rinse whatever you need to rinse in alcohol so you don't get an infection? Is rinsing suspension rig hooks in alcohol too much of a chore? <br /><br />3. Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc. It was so obvious he was one of them. This was only 20 minutes into the film.<br /><br />4. The Ending: At the end when Aidan comes home after his son dies, he wakes up Sean and Sean asks where Alex is. After telling Sean not to worry about Alex, the credits start rolling. I'm not even kidding. That's the ending. I expected a funeral before the credits started rolling. You usually get that in movies but not in this one.<br /><br />There is one scene that just bugged me. There was a homosexual who invites his bigoted brother to a restaurant to chat. Instead, he drugs his coffee and takes him to an abandoned building and hooks him up to a rig. Before his brother wakes up, he fills a syringe up with a medicine of some kind. I think it might have been PCP or a very powerful drug like morphine. After he does this, he wakes up his brother and proceeds to kill himself in a very gruesome manner in front of him. He tells his brother he must do this because he is gay and that he doesn't deserve to live in this world.<br /><br />That is unacceptable. There are hundreds of gay teenagers all over the country who kill themselves. We shouldn't use a scene like that in this movie. Who knows, this movie might make the problem worse. Maybe some heterosexual will get the idea that if they cuss, taunt, and harass them enough, they'll kill themselves. This is very inappropriate and very, very dangerous. The movie could have done without this scene.<br /><br />That's most of the movie. I hope Dennis Quaid chooses better roles. I would hate to see his career wind up in the toilet cause he chose to star in a lot of bad movies.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10."
39387_0,"I saw this movie at the NatFilm festival (Nightly Movies Festival) in Copenhagen, and it was a huge disappointment. I found the movie virtually void of a story and hopelessly over-stretched. The only reason I have not used profanity here are the IMDb guidelines, the movie is THAT bad.<br /><br />On a more cheerful note: Most of the cinema-goers that evening managed to sleep some time during the movie (myself included), so after the movie people were well rested. Considering the usual cinema-goers at that festival it is quite an achievement.<br /><br />I rate this a 1 out of 10. (Because it is impossible to cast a lower vote)"
39431_0,"I watched this movie because I'm pretty big Michael Cera fan and really nothing he's been in so far has been terrible... however, this movie looks like it was begging not to be watched. With a title like Extreme Movie, an embarrassing cover, and the fact that it's a Blockbuster Exclusive, honestly doesn't give it very much appeal. However, the cast seemed pretty good, the directors made a hilarious spoof movie (I loved Not Another Teen Movie), and the writers were impressive, many big name Saturday Night Live writers. <br /><br />Even with all that hidden talent though, the movie turns out to be exactly how the DVD case made it seem... embarrassing. For the most part very, very low brow humor with not very spectacular timing or very good taste. The movie for some reason plays like a typical American Pie storyline with sketches randomly thrown in. Some of these sketches made me chuckle, but for the most part, every sketch went on way, way too long. <br /><br />Michael Cera's sketch though actually had me laughing for a few hours after I had already watched the movie. It might seemed a little biased because he was the reason I watching the movie, but really his sketch was the only one that was casted perfectly. He's only in the movie for maybe ten minutes, if even that, and the first couple of minutes really nothing happened. However, if you're not sick of Michael Cera's awkwardness yet, then it's used perfectly here. <br /><br />Other than that, Jamie Kennedy's sketch made me went to take a shower after watching it. Really disgusting. Thought I was watching porn... actually the majority of the movie kind of feels that way... Matthew Lillard's portions of the film were incredibly unfunny. He basically just sits in a chair and throws at you the old sex advice jokes you've heard from so many standups in the past. Honestly, this isn't a movie I would recommend. If you've been enjoying the movies Michael Cera has been putting out... then probably skip this one. It's really not worth waiting forty minutes from him to appear only to disappear moments later."
39477_0,"This movie is brutal from start to finish. Obviously the writer/director don't necessarily believe in the old adage of ""anything worth doing is worth doing well"". The director has no knowledge of bear behavior or safety. Which you should have if your going to make a movie with a bear. First of all you cant just hide around a tree/corner from a bear, cause bear's have a keen sense of smell. Second, the amplified bear sounds and the shots of the bear at least initially were horrible. The night scenes...you cant hardly see anything, not to mention some of the other camera work. And the ending is brutal...well why would it be any different than the rest of the movie. I cant believe that this movie made it past the editing phase."
39521_0,"I am fully aware that no film adaptation of a novel can remain completely faithful to its source. It is just not possible to do- most novels are too nuanced and large to be comfortably fitted into a two hour movie. However, it is possible for a film to capture the message and tone of a novel by keeping true to its narrative. Yet Disney's film adaption of Esther Forbes 1943 novel for young and old, ""Johnny Tremain,"" failed to stay true to the narrative of the book and the result is a thoroughly mediocre and bland movie.<br /><br />Set in Revolutionary era Boston, Forbes' novel is the story of a bright, talented, and cocky fourteen year old silversmith apprentice, Johnny Tremain, who because of an accident which cripples his hand finds himself without a profession. Without a future as a silversmith, Johnny must find a new life and career. Along the way he finds himself swept up in the events around Boston in the mid 1770's that culminated in the American Revolution. Johnny becomes involved in the clandestine activities of the Sons of Liberty. He participates in the Boston Tea Party, spies on the British, and mingles with such patriots as John Hancock, Sam Adams, and Paul Revere. The strength of the novel is how Forbes so effortlessly weaved the fictional story of Johnny in with actual historical events and persons. It is just a brilliant work of historical fiction.<br /><br />One would think that a film studio could not make a complete hash of such terrific source material. Yet Disney did. Disney did what is usually expected of film versions of novels- it jettisoned ""minor"" characters and subplots to streamline the story. That's understandable. What is not forgivable is completely changing the message and tone of the novel in order to have lots of action scenes and a happy ending. In the book, Johnny only hears of about the fighting at Lexington and Concord- in the movie Johnny is shown in the thick of the fighting. That's understandable (film's need action), but what is not forgivable is the ridiculous joyousness of the battle scenes- Johnny and his friend, Rab, hide behind trees, shoot at redcoats, and seem to be having a grand time! They also occasionally break out into song- ""Oh, we are the Sons, oh, we are the Sons, the Sons of Liberty!"" (It's just as bad as one could imagine.) Disney selling war as a boys' adventure is exactly the opposite of what Forbes intended in her novel.<br /><br />Forbes was not cynical about the ideal of American Revolution- the war was fought so that ""a man could stand up."" However, Forbes let the reader know that that simple hope came at a terrible price. The character of Rab, Johnny's best friend, is a remarkable seventeen year old boy. He's smart, handsome, fearless, and oozes charisma. He's a boy destined to be a great man. Yet it's not be. At Lexington Green, as Rab stands among the Minutemen confronting the might of the British Empire, he is mortally wounded in the first volley. He never even got a chance to fire his own musket. He dies the next day, propped up in a chair with blood pouring from his mouth. Forbes wanted young readers to know that war is not a boy's adventure- it robs the world of its best and brightest at a very young age. By having Rab walking around, alive and well, and singing that awful song at film's end, Disney succeeded in completely botching its film adaption of ""Johnny Tremain."" This is one book that is crying for a remake!"
39567_0,"While I can't add anything to my summary, it requires 10 lines to submit a rating so I have to add more comment.<br /><br />This movie is a major distortion of the Iraq war.<br /><br />It is depressing, bringing out the worst part of any war, and is not representative of what our brave troops do, or what the vast majority of them live with when they return to our country.<br /><br />It is a cliché.<br /><br />It offers the worst of what the Vietnam War offered viewed through the Communist propaganda of that time, pretending to be about a war against the Iraqi people.<br /><br />It is a battle against anti-freedom Sadam supporters and the terrorists that attacked our country. Regardless of our feelings toward Bush, we need to fight Al-Queda there, because that is where they chose, or else we will be fighting them here, in LA, NYC, Atlanta, and Omaha.<br /><br />It is a FAR left vision of reality- distorted to show the minimum as if it were the maximum.<br /><br />It ignores the social benefits our troops have supplied to the Iraqi people, and ignored the awful life the Iraqi's had under that awful dictator and his rapist, sadist, boys.<br /><br />It doesn't represent the accomplishments of the troops at that time and certainly not the major accomplishments reported over the last couple years in the Associated Press or Reuters.<br /><br />It is, simply, an awful movie that is anti-American, and against our courageous volunteer army.<br /><br />When will Hollywood learn that insulting the American people will not generate either a great movie, or a popular movie???"
39611_0,"I found this movie very dreary, distracting, and slow going. Don't know if this was the intent of the production team, but if it was they succeeded admirably. Basically all it was to me was the very depressing story of an annoyingly dysfunctional family with seemingly very little else to offer the world --- not the kind of neighbors I would like near my ranch. Production-wise I did like Robert Mitchum's red coat and the movie did bring out the ultimate dreariness of wide open snow country. Some people like this sort of slow going, dysfunctional-family in the movies stuff. I generally don't, especially when the movie drags on as this movie does. Never thought I would place any Robert Mitchum or Teresa Wright (despite her relatively minor role) movie on my not-to-watch-again list of older movies, but that's where this film goes. One viewing is barely tolerable, any more would be just too taxing. I guess I'm not ""sophisticated"" enough. It's not why I watch movies. Blah!"
39657_0,"If you are a fan of any of the main actors, you will like this film.<br /><br />If you enjoy seeing Paltrow pose in refined interiors in expensive clothes, or very few clothes, as she talks through clenched teeth, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching Douglas' subtle mastery of the acting art, and lending depth to a character that in lesser hands would be as flat as wallpaper, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching Morgenstern sporting medieval hygiene and chewing the scenery, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy lamenting that the always-remarkable Suchet is woefully underused, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />If you like movies that are intelligently scripted, plotted, cast and/or directed, this is not a movie for you.

39701_0,"This movie opens by introducing us to Squanto and his fellow tribe members . We`re shown that despite being unsophisticated and non white European they are still capable of being noble , loving and caring members of the human race . I don`t dispute that white European doesn`t always = good anymore than non white European = bad but you do get the impression that if any white Europeans turned up they`d instantly be the bad guys . True to form a ship comes sailing into the horizon<br /><br />Right away the movie becomes totally anachronistic as the ship hoists the British union flag . The act of union between England and Scotland didn`t happen until 1707 while the St Patrick cross of Ireland wasn`t added to the flag until later still so considering this movie is set in 1620 it`s totally wrong . There`s other anachronistic details when the action ( Inaction more like - This is a boring movie ) tranfers to England which I won`t bore you with since you`ll be bored enough without my help . Oh and Britain was the first country to abolish slavery in the early 19th century , just thought I`d point this out since A WARRIOR`S TALE really does seem to think all the evil in the world began and ended with The British empire even if in 1620 Britain as a country didn`t exist as such <br /><br />A word about the acting - It`s totally variable . Alex Norton gives a good performance as a one dimensional bad guy and OZ fans will notice Mark Margolis do a very convincing English accent . However nearly everyone else is totally wooden while Michael Gambon gives a truly ridiculous performance<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to evaluate this movie`s true worth is for me to point out my local ITV network broadcast it at 1.40 am"

Even the silly sequel, National Lampoon´s European Vacation, seems rather fun in comparison. The jokes are predictable and rarely hit the spot. It´s difficult for Chase to do anything with this material, his acting skills definitely deserves better scripts. Madolyn Smith is not bad as his wife, and it´s rather surprising that she hasn´t done any acting since 1994.<br /><br />With a pretty promising plot, the movie could have been a funny trip to the countryside, but Chevy Chase has done much better movies.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar is seen in a blink-and-you-miss-her appearance, and this might be fun to check out for Buffy-fans.

39792_0,"When I was 17, I was kind of fascinated by this kind of (typically french) movies. The absence of action in the story telling would reveal some hidden gem, some kind of unknown, deep, mysterious truth, about life and all the unexpected things that could happen. Like meeting someone one evening and then spending the night without knowing anything about each other, without even exchanging a few sentences. Yeah that would appear to be exciting, revolutionary, unusual, unconventional. Now, 36 years later, I've had a few strange encounters in my life (like anybody else, I guess), but then... so what? Nothing to make a fuss about, and certainly not a movie. These moments weren't any deeper or more significant than other events that proved to be far more ecstatic or painful. The absence of any meaningful dialog in a script doesn't make a movie more special or poetic by itself. These long close shots on the actor's eyes don't lead anywhere if the author has no intention, no other purpose but to please himself/herself. After I watched the whole movie, I was left with a feeling of emptiness, that is, the author's emptiness. This film is about nothing, but it tries to conceal that behind smart camera movements, little action and no story. It has nothing to say, but would make us believe it's nothingness reveals something about life. Well it doesn't."
39837_0,Stunning - - absolutely stunning visually. If for no other reason to see the film BUT -- the sound is awful. You can't understand everyone. It's hollow! You would think with all the producers on this film - that they would be conscious of everything. They were so sensitive to the perfect costuming and sets. But the sound? Yikes! It spoiled it for me...<br /><br />Was it because it was in Dolby 5.1 -- and we didn't watch it in Dolby 5.1 ???<br /><br />There also was not enough explanation as to what was going on. Otherwise it would be PERFECT for school children to see. It would have taken so little effort to explain things..<br /><br />I can only assume this contributed to the films unpopularity. I never heard of it. I took a chance on it seeing it on the library shelf... and was immediately impressed with the costuming and sets. But try to understand it? I put it back on the shelf... and forgot it...

39972_0,"From what I had heard and read of this movie, I was rather expecting to find a gripping story of animal activism in Africa, somewhat akin to ""Gorillas in The Mist."" But there's nothing like this here. What we get is a confusing story, in which the plotline jumps from scene to scene with no apparent pattern or purpose.<br /><br />The performances are generally sub-par. Kim Basinger plays Kuki Gallman, the real-life conservationist, as we learn the story of how she got to Africa in the first place. Basinger showed a few sparks throughout the movie, but for the most part came across as rather distant. Vincent Perez was, I thought, a terrible disappointment as her husband Paolo. These two never struck me as being a likely couple, and there seemed to be little reality to their romance.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely holding the movie together is its anti-poaching theme, but even that consists of a series of scenes seemingly spaced about twenty minutes apart where we see a dead animal, and Basinger and Perez get angry. I never got a real sense of what they wanted to do to make any real effort to improve the situation.<br /><br />There is some wonderful photography of both the African landscape and wildlife, but aside from that this movie is a tremendous disappointment. I rated it 2/10."
40015_0,"Extremely slight film-version of Harry Segall's play ""Heaven Can Wait"" stars Robert Montgomery as a boxer who receives an unexpected transfer of his soul by a novice angel who thought the boxer was to die in a plane accident. Exposition-heavy fantasy keeps stressing the same trivial points over and over, and Montgomery is rather tepid in the lead (the whole film depends upon his performance, but Montgomery hasn't that much charisma as an actor to carry the weight). Some sweet scenes, but the rest is piffle. Remade by Warren Beatty (as ""Heaven Can Wait"") in 1978, there's something about this material that none of the writers were able to solve: the circumstances of the plotting work against our sympathies for several supporting characters, who ultimately are left out of the happy ending. ** from ****"
40060_0,"The early 1980s saw Britain gripped by a wave of moral panic similar to the hysteria that shook 1950s America concerning the content of EC's horror comics. Only this time, it was a batch of gruesome B-movies from the 1970s that were aggravating the blue-nosed guardians of public decency as well as the government and certain over-zealous members of the police force. These were the days of the 'video nasty', when the likes of Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave and Sam Raimi's the Evil Dead were available to rent, uncut and uncensored, from your local friendly video library. The tabloid press had a field day, comparing video dealers to drug pushers, whipping up a good old-fashioned frenzy of moral panic among their readers and (naturally) offering blow-by-blow descriptions of the goriest, sleaziest scenes from these oh-so-shocking films in case anyone was left wondering what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />This was the climate into which the 'controversial' (in so far as he ignored politically correct concerns, enjoyed the company of scantily-clad women on his programmes and thought no joke was too tasteless or too obvious to pass up - and often made use of pantomime blood and gore effects that even Monty Python would have balked at) comedian Kenny Everett released his one and only feature film, Bloodbath at the House of Death. Yes, the legendary 'Ev' chose to release a gory, smutty, lip-smackingly excessive horror spoof - just as the genuine articles were being impounded, banned and burned, lest they fall into the hands of impressionable tots. That, along with the ever-cautious British Board of Film Censors' decision to award it an 18 certificate (meaning Everett's fan-base of school-kids and young teens couldn't get into the cinemas to see it), an almost unanimous critical mauling (Kim Newman's excellent reference work, Nightmare Movies, describes Bloodbath as ""excruciating"") and the simple fact that none of Everett's best-known characters (Gizzard Puke, Sid Snot, Cupid Stunt etc) don't get so much as a look-in, meant that Bloodbath was a monumental flop - and Everett's film career was as short-lived as some of the characters herein.<br /><br />The disconcerting thing about Bloodbath is that it doesn't really know what it wants to be. There's none of the fast-paced, joke-a-second, semi-hysterical mayhem that marked the best of Everett's television work, and (surprisingly for a film scripted by Barry Cryer) there are very few actual jokes - indeed, when director Ray Cameron presents the viewer (in the opening moments) with a barrage of shockingly violent murders, shot and staged in a bizarrely straight-faced manner, one has to wonder what on earth is going on. And the remainder of the film doesn't offer a great deal of laughs either.<br /><br />Outside of some amusing set-pieces, like the much-discussed Carrie-inspired decapitation by can-opener, Everett's short-tempered surgeon yanking the innards out of his patient to hurl at his derisive colleagues, the use of John Williams' ominous theme from Jaws (the punchline to this bit is best left to the adventurous viewer) and virtually every moment spent in the company of a deliriously hammy Vincent Price, Bloodbath is a dour and po-faced affair indeed, saddled with rather too much genuine tastelessness (Pamela Stephenson rapidly coming to enjoy being raped by a poltergeist, for example) and the most feeble of finales to make much of an impact. The plot - what there is of it - is simply forgotten halfway, and Everett isn't given nearly enough screen time, which is a real shame given the talent for (admittedly broad) characterisation his best television work displayed.<br /><br />For the record, the executive producer Laurence Myers was also responsible for the nerve-shreddingly awful Gary Glitter vehicle 'Remember Me This Way', the low-budget glam-rock ragbag 'Never Too Young To Rock' and the oddly entertaining seventies time capsule 'Side By Side'. Not exactly an impressive track record, but at least he was well used to backing losers by the time Bloodbath came out."
40105_0,"Never having seen a Butler Brothers Production before, I came into this film fresh and with no bias one way or the other. I'd read both pro and con reviews of their previous movies (ALIVE AND LUBRICATED, BUMS, etc.) and thought these zany brothers might be worth checking out. Having received and watched CONFUSIONS OF AN UNMARRIED COUPLE, I must say that there are both pro and cons in this one little film and, unfortunately, the cons tip the scale a bit too much for a positive rating.<br /><br />The most appealing aspect of the film is undoubtedly the snappy dialogue and the comedy it contains. Watching Dan (Brett Butler) try to sneak his old mattress out his ex-girlfriend's apartment was pretty damn funny (note: this is attempted while his ex is still in the apartment). His comment ""We need to talk"" while peaking out from behind the would-be stolen mattress is quite hysterical. The downside to the dialogue is its delivery. Brett may be a fine film maker, but he's not an actor. His lines are delivered in queue-card fashion with poor (or little) emotion. Naomi Johnson as Lisa (his ex) does a more admirable job, using both good facial contortions and voice modulation to get her side of the story across.<br /><br />The fact that this is a story about messed up relationships is old territory covered many, many times, too. This accompanied by the continual panning back and forth of the camera during conversations/arguments makes for an old and stilted feel. I'm sure the intention was to give the audience the sense that they were the camera, watching this story unfold, but the effect gets tiring and irritating after a very short time.<br /><br />The other sense (for me, at least) was that I was watching a soft-porn film without the sex. The verbiage was there  the f-word being used liberally, as well as other profanities  and felt abused/overused rather than natural flowing dialogue or shocking. I'm no prude and enjoy the occasional merry chorus of ""F-yous"", too, but Confusions of an Unmarried Couple went overboard.<br /><br />I understand the budgetary constraints of such a small production and seriously appreciated what Brett and Jason Butler were doing here. They just needed to avail themselves of better filming techniques (i.e., not the continual panning) and find an actor who could play the Dan character with an edgy style, and I feel almost certain that the film would've received much more praise from me ...and perhaps others."
40150_0,"At one point, still very early in the film, the male lead character can be seen reading a copy of Jules Verne's legendary novel ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" and even later in the film the book is mentioned several times more. This wasn't a coincidental choice, as the novel (and even more so the classic 50's film starring Kirk Douglas) largely introduced and immediately popularized the notorious Kraken-monster. The Kraken, these days primarily known as the thing that swallowed Johnny Depp in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", is a gigantic type of squid that can reach a size of nearly 46 feet and reigns over the darkest depths of the sea. Normally the Kraken only lives in the Northern regions, like the cold seas of Norway and Iceland, but according to the script of this low-keyed and forgettable made-for-TV creature feature, the monster can easily also dwell American ocean stretches and it suddenly even got promoted to being the guardian of ancient Greek artifacts! For you see, the Kraken's territory in ""Deadly Waters"" encompasses Desolation Passage because that's where the valuable opal rests in a shipwreck, and the monster attacks everyone who sails in this passage, whether their intentions are bad (like multiple treasure hunters) or harmless (like Ray's parents). This may sound like a very interesting concept for a monstrous horror movie, but ""Deadly Waters"" is dreadfully boring and poorly made. I anticipated the giant squid monster to be entirely computer engineered, but it's even worse that anyone could fear, as it looks like a cute and big-eyed underwater puppy. The Kraken never looks menacing, not even when its tentacles embrace a medium-sized ship. The underwater cinematography is unclear and the monster's attacks are never properly shown, for obvious reasons. At best, we see people getting thrown into the water and pulled down to the depths. With a slight bit of luck, the water even colors a bit red. The acting performances are weak and the characters totally implausible. Nicole and Jenny hardly look like brilliant archaeologists in their tiny bikinis and Jack Scalia is probably the least convincing mafia lord ever. Why did I watch this junk, I do not know. They should make a law against the spreading of TV-movies in video stores, especially when they do not indicate anywhere it's a TV movie! Director Tibor Takács might consider a late career change, as he hasn't accomplished anything special since the late 80's, when he made ""The Gate"" and ""I, Madman""."
40196_0,"Outside the train station of Marseille, through which many a Frenchman left for the colonies, stands a 19th-century statue allegorically depicting Indochina as three half-naked girls lounging in the tropical sun. It's the perfect encapsulation of the colonial stereotype that South East Asian women are childlike, naive and sensual. The statue tells you more about the men who commissioned it - men who probably never set foot in the colonies - than about the realities of French Indochina.<br /><br />Cut to 1992 and here's a French movie about Vietnam in which the only major Vietnamese character is, you guessed it, a childlike, naive and sensual young girl. If it wasn't that this movie was to a large extent shot in Vietnam, you'd think the makers never set foot there: this is a movie set on plantations, in gambling halls and opium-dens, a catalogue of colonial clichés.<br /><br />The story, such as it is, involves a French plantation holder (Catherine Deneuve) and her adoptive daughter, a Vietnamese royal (Linh Dan Pham) growing apart during the anti-French uprising. Taken as a metaphor for colonialism, the adoptive-daughter-angle is beyond patronizing (I much prefer Graham Greene's morality play of The Quiet American: Vietnam as a whore being fought over by an old European and a young American).<br /><br />Sure, the makers feel obliged to take a stand against colonialism, but the content is betrayed by the prettiness of their images. It's hard to take serious the message of a movie in which Vietnamese princesses elope with dashing young French officers and sail a dhow through Ha Long Bay, Vietnam's most scenic tourist spot. This movie is so busy wallowing in the nostalgia of a lost and largely imagined past that it makes any pro-independence stance null and void.<br /><br />Even the downtrodden masses look picturesque."
40240_0,"So the anti-Bush campaign that makes up the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are pretty clear. Even the attack on Bush's anti-gay tendencies are pretty clear. What's not clear is what the movie's trying to do. Jack is a corporate employee with serious potential who finds himself unemployed because of his refusal to ignore the massive corporate corruption with which he suddenly finds himself surrounded. So then he goes home to his fancy apartment, which he can no longer afford to maintain, and then has to deal with the torturous proposal of impregnating lesbians at $10,000 a piece.<br /><br />The most difficult endeavor that the movie takes on is in trying to make us believe that Jack was actually conflicted about all of this, and it fails miserably. There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his ex-girlfriend, the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack, but only after her. <br /><br />Keep in mind that their breakup happened FOUR YEARS EARLIER, and not only was he belligerently furious to come home and find his sexy girlfriend having sex with another sexy woman, but he hasn't gotten over it four years later. They actually get into screaming arguments in the movie about this ancient history between themselves. <br /><br />I'm reminded of one of Julia Roberts' many great lines from Closer  ""What are you, 12?""<br /><br />So while he's not busy acting like a junior high school kid who's heartbroken about some girl who cheated on him, he's having sex with whole lines of lesbians and trying to act like it's just hell to him. Please. At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk, for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real, real good reason for him to hate doing it, and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough.<br /><br />I can accept that the movie wants to suggest that this guy genuinely loved his girlfriend and truly feels like he has lost the love of his life, but let me tell you one thing. Showing a guy suffer through Every Man's Fantasy is not the way to do it. At all. Unless, of course, you have some ulterior political motive, but that's just not Spike Lee's style, right? Right? <br /><br />I won't spend much time talking about the ludicrous premise about the lesbians. Whether you've seen the movie or not, you probably already know all about it. The problem is that you also come into the movie already knowing what a socially and politically conscious filmmaker Spike Lee is. We know that he is going to be making political statements in the film, and some of them are clear while others are not, unless Spike has completely lost all sense of balance. There are scenes where it is increasingly obvious what social ills are being dealt with, such as the terrible scene where Jack has some wooden and massively unrealistic conversation with his friend, who is trying to make money donating sperm. It's a god-awful scene, but it's relatively clear what is being said. <br /><br />I could, of course, come up with some pretty solid theories about what is being said about the homosexual content of the film, how Jack the black man is forced to descend to that level, but it is such a gigantic portion of the film that it even overshadows that picture of Bush on the $3 bill at the end of the opening credits, and that's a difficult image to overshadow. Lee puts so much stock into the lesbians in this movie that it borders on low- grade soft porn. <br /><br />At one point in the movie, while bike riding together, Jack's brother gives him a bright, sparkling gem of advice  get a vasectomy and call it a day. Now, there are two things that could lead a man to give such advice to his brother. First, it could be because he's been having too much sex, or second, it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it. Either way, it's a good reason never to take advice from your brother again. Jack, of course, reacts by throwing a temper tantrum like an 8 year old kid, resulting in one of the great many scenes that made me want to put a pot over my head and start beating on it with a serving ladle. <br /><br />One of the biggest problems with the movie is that not only does it bore and irritate but it deliberately insults the audience. Granted, I didn't know a lot of the details about some of the homages that are made in the film, such as the XFL player that inspired the title of the film and the security guard who exposed the Watergate break-in and ruined his own life in the process. I can understand if Lee wants us to be aware of what he's talking about, but he literally stops his movie to put these stories up on billboards and then hits us over the head with them. <br /><br />By the end of the movie I was literally standing up, pacing back and forth I was so irritated and desperate for it to end. There are times when I wish I didn't have this determination to finish watching movies, even the abysmally terrible ones. <br /><br />The really sad thing about She Hate Me is that it isn't even not very good for a Spike Lee film, this is just a bad movie overall. It's almost weird to think that it was directed by the same man that directed true classics like Do The Right Thing, one of my all time favorite films. She Hate Me is Spike Lee's version of Spielberg's 1941, but worse.<br /><br />Much worse."
40286_0,"This tale of fussin' and a feudin' is showing its age in spades, but at least it benefits from a memorable cast: Randolph Scott, Buster Crabbe, John Carradine, and little Shirley Temple, whose doll gets its head shot off. Jack La Rue plays the villain and is in desperate need of a moustache to twirl."
40330_0,"I'm trying hard to think of alternatives, but i think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. That said, I'm pretty generous when it comes to reviewing movies, I can normally look past problems and just get a few laughs, or shocks, or whatever out of a mediocre move and then be happy. But Sunshine not only disappointed me, but it enraged me that such a thing could be.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me was massive lack of realism. I already knew the story was about the sun going out, but I didn't mind that too much, a movie is allowed to bend physics for the sake of plot, but when a reported brightness increase from 2% to 3.1% changed from a dim glow to blinding white any suspension of disbelief I could have ever attempted was crushed. Still, it may have been jarring, things such as the >1 year journey that is inside earths orbit also jarred me, but other than that first one I don't think the average viewer should have noticed, and unreal-ism, even in the case of this movie, shouldn't lose more than 1 point from movie's score, rather it was the plethora of other problems that doomed Sunshine.<br /><br />While still not absolutely crushing the movie, the characters themselves certainly ensured it could never get a rating better than ""semi-decent"". The characters showed the average intelligence and foresight of a dead maggot. these problems ranged from the relatively benign; such as when near the start of the movie a crew member did all the necessary procedures for changing the ship's course entirely on his own, not even asking another crew member to skim his work for problems; to the absolutely ridiculous ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it"". That quote comes from a section where one of the crew decides to angle the deflector in such a way that a portion of the ship will be annihilated with 100% certainty. The rationale behind this decision (and the quote) was that ""they weren't using that part of the ship at the moment"". Many other such things happened, some even more ridiculous, such as venting the entire oxygen supply into a fire so it will burn faster, with no real reason given exactly why they would want that, though ""We'll cross that bridge"" was a personal favourite.<br /><br />Even with the above massive stupidities (which seem to be the main driving force for the movie's plot) the movie still would have had a chance for maybe 3 or 4 out of 10, but alas, it was not to be. the movie's plot firmly cemented it in the ""Avoid this movie at all costs"" zone. The plot starts out simple and understandable, deliver the Dues Ex mechina to the sun, it soon takes a twist, that under normal circumstances would add to a movie, by finding the previous, failed mission to the sun. At this point everything is as you should expect, problems arise, the crew has to fix problems, think of a sci-fi version of Apollo 13, except really bad. It could have still gotten 2/10 at this point, at least it would be reminiscent of a great movie, but at this point the plot turns to ""We need to kill crew members to conserve oxygen!"" and it carries this plot worse than your average fan-fiction. At this point my mind wandered to how this movie could have gotten one extra star if it had asked an interesting question, such as if humanity is worth saving if it will so readily kill it's own (still a questionable question). Instead, it asks a flat and simple ""Is the crew more important than the mission?"" and before you can think it answers ""No! The mission is all-important!"" in what seems like a bad ripoff of 2001 or (less related to the main plot) Alien. None of that matters though, because at the end it turns into ""There's a madman on the ship!!!!"" (More Alien allusion?) complete with scary sound and visual effects.<br /><br />There were other problems, such as generally confusing parts, (Looks like he made it to the other part of the ship only for it to explode.... oh, wait, turns out he was going the other way!) tonnes of sections that seem directly ripped from other movies, (""I'm sorry unmemorable crew member #1, I can't let you do that"", but don't worry, it's only HAL for one scene) and parts that just didn't seem to make sense (Why did the hydroponics section catch fire? and why didn't the computer warn them 'till half an hour later).<br /><br />Finally, what could have been the redeeming factor of the movie, if it was redeemable at all, were the special effects. Even then they were ""neat"" but nothing to write home about, and for those hoping for a fancy flashy colourful special effect when the ""Plot Device"" activates at the end, there isn't one, seems you just can't win.<br /><br />For me, the highlight of this movie was being able to write the summary for this comment, and I think that should speak louder than anything else."

40420_0,"First, a word of caution. As an American, I am not familiar with Norman Wisdom. I know that he's a bit of a British institution and he was beloved behind the old Iron Curtain, but his movies and television programs were not popular here in the States--in fact, he's almost completely unknown. Because of this, I don't have the sentimental attachment to him or his work. What went over well years ago does not necessarily translate well to today--at least if you aren't already a fan. I just saw TROUBLE IN STORE and didn't particularly like it. However, I am a glutton for punishment so I decided to try his films one more time.<br /><br />However, before the film began, I read through the reviews on IMDb. Unlike the universally positive ones for TROUBLE IN STORE, the reviews for JUST MY LUCK seemed strangely divergent. Either they loved the film or they disliked it strongly--with not much opinion in between. That's pretty interesting but also didn't help me decide whether or not to watch the film.<br /><br />Well, my initial instincts were unfortunately correct. I didn't particularly like the film, as JUST MY LUCK seemed an awful lot like a Jerry Lewis film--with broad humor and comic bits that were overdone--with every last bit of comedy squeezed dry from the skits. For example, the movie theater scene is just dreadful--going so far overboard with its timing and pace.<br /><br />My advice is that if you are British or Albanian or Russian, by all means see and enjoy this film. Otherwise, it might just be tough to take for more than about 30 minutes. And, no, this is NOT like Mr. Bean in any way, despite another review to the contrary. Mr. Bean is funny (especially the original TV show)."
40466_0,"<br /><br />The great Welles only total failure. the film lacks humanity,it lacks poetry and above all it lacks interest. Welles creates a world where Macbeth is pawn of the supernatural,not a good man who is influenced by a prophecy and an ambitious wife. and speaking of the ambitious wife can anyone have given a more wooden performance of the greatest female role ever written? Jeannette Nolan is awful. not passion,no emotion. she seems life a cartoon villain. she can't even move well on screen! the only performance worth mentioning is Roddy McDowall's understated Malcom. his is the only unaffected portrayal in this disheatening film."
40510_0,"Fann Wong (Yes, weird name) . Just because some industry bigwig thought she was photogenic and popular with teenagers, she was cast in this picture. Peter Ho is a singer by trade and this is his first time acting. Though they look like they could sell toothpaste together, they certainly can't sell movies. This movie was a thorough waste of time and it nearly bored me to tears in the cinema.<br /><br />""The truth about Jane and Sam"" is a totally shallow work employing the oldest plot in the book. A cynical, jaded woman (Fann Wong) in Hong Kong, meets Singaporean journalist(Peter Ho). At first they don't like one another, then he finds she is actually a sweet, nice girl inside. Then they end up going to bed. The next morning, POW! she is in the kitchen (how domestic) , making him breakfast.<br /><br />This is just a movie to cheat impressional teenagers of their allowances. By the way, the soundtrack sucks too. Thank goodness they didn't let Fann Wong sing the theme song. . Watch this movie at your own peril."
40556_0,"It's impossible for me to find a rating that reflects the overall quality of the show. It started out strong; the first season was far from perfect, but it had an energy and a message that simply felt good. There were incredibly fulfilling episodes, such as Homecoming, Company Man, Five Years Gone, and heart-warming character moments not just for a few, but for most characters. I felt safe with this show. Anyway, one of the show's biggest problems became obvious in th finale, when all the character came together for a mostly underwhelming showdown. Somehow, Heroes was best when it did not follow closely to a plan, but allowed its characters some room to develop naturally. The best moments and characters of Season 1 are thanks to the writers having enough sense to use the opportunities that opened up. When Noah Bennet proved a more interesting character than previously hoped for, his role became bigger. The same for Sylar. The enmity between Mohinder and Sylar. Molly. It all grew naturally, and lost its momentum only when everything was yanked back into the intended showdown.<br /><br />The second season put a damper on the mood. What fans wants to wait a whole season only to find out one of their favourite characters died between seasons? I'm one of the few who didn't mind the new characters. They felt fresh and gave new impulses, showed us new perspectives on their power. What really slowed the series down to a crawl was the need to force certain other characters back into the plot, even though they no longer had any purpose, and should in fact have died in the season finale. Since the writers could not think of what to do with these characters (Nathan, Peter, Claire mostly) they simply rehashed their previous story lines. But there was still enough to keep me interested, and I thought that if I could see the problems of Season 2, then surely the writers could see them as well.<br /><br />Sadly, Season 3 came and was a nightmare, a disaster. Characters were written off, other characters had their backstories and even basic motivations retconned. The once international cast was suddenly down to three (two of which are the Asian comic relief), and all the characters who had already run out of steam by the end of Season 1 were now front and centre, source and solution of the problems. Showrunner Tim Kring now declared that Heroes was actually about the Petrellis and the Bennets. Had I known that from the start, I wouldn't have bothered - I started watching when he described the show to be about ""ordinary people across the globe"". Instead, Heroes is now about a bunch of upper-class New Yorkers ensuring one another that it's okay they started a genocide. Heroes did the impossible with Season 3: they made a show that bears little to no resemblance to Season 1. They also managed to make Sylar into one of the most obnoxious characters on TV. They shed all pretension of being interested in diversity. Consistency and continuity have been tossed overboard, not just in regard to previous season, but even with things established just an episode earlier. <br /><br />I chose the rating to reflect this disappointment, too. If I was to judge only the first two seasons, the rating would be considerably higher. But in the end, the complete product shows a disrespect towards the audience, a hatred for its own characters and story lines except a few precious upper-class New Yorkers, like I've never seen it before. It leaves a foul taste in my mouth. As a viewer, you're lost. Can I grow attached to this character, or will he die, or will the next episode forget he existed, will this storyline be dropped or will his entire personality be switched around? Probably. What reason is there to watch?"
40600_0,"I first saw 'Social Misfits' under the recommendation of a friend. I was expecting your usual independent film, filled with plot holes, script errors, and cheesy cliches, but I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised. One of the best things about the movie was that it took a piece of society that usually isn't dealt with in Hollywood, and presented it honestly and realistically, without any icing on top. It is the story of a group of problematic teenagers, sent to a non-governmental, privately-funded rehabilitation camp. It is the camp's intention to bring the teens face to face with their problems, although in a rather unorthodox manner. This is done by forcing them to spend 48 hours together in one room. Straightaway, it is obvious that there will be clashes and tension between the characters, all with their own ethnic backgrounds and beliefs. The film presents a good mix of races, classes, and behavioural problems, all of which come to light with a self-confession from but one character. Certain events bring them together and help them to put their differences aside for the sake of moral decency.<br /><br />The young actors all did a good job of representing their parts in a manner that is both believable and well-fitted. The movie was well cast in the fact that they actually look like they're teenagers, without glamourous effects to gloss it over. To say the very least, the movie is to the point, runs almost at times like a real-life documentary, and it neither repetitive nor boring. The plot has a bit of a twist at the end with one of the character's revelation of his problem, which adds a sting. I definitely recommend if you want a piece of true life youth in America, without the sugar coating. The movie's tagline said it well, ""A wake up call for America."""
40646_0,"Watched the original Men Behind the Sun, and then this sequel. This was English dubbed though. Cantonese version may have been way better. Anyway, from the 1st 2 minutes I felt this is some awkward attempt to ride on the ""success"" of the first movie.<br /><br />Story about Japanese biological weapons development with some off-topic (maybe I missed something?) autopsies. Some shots are clearly ripped from the first one, like the liquid nitrogen demonstrations and when the leader dude stands in front of the japan flag & his ""army"". If you haven't seen the original movie, you may like this, anyway I was so much disappointed I recommend watching ""Men Behind the Sun"" or even ""Mermaid in a Manhole"" instead, and skip this one."
40691_0,"I was led to buy the first two DVDs from the glowing comments I read on this site and from having really enjoyed James Herriot's books which I've read and reread over the years. Well, books do not age or hardly but films (and TV films most especially) do. So I really do not recommend buying those DVDs unless one is nostalgic of static camera work, slow pace, bad special effects and mediocre acting from all but Robert Hardy, the actor portraying Siegfried (but I never pictured him that way from reading the book - I think he's described as tall, dark and elegant, and I imagined him much, much younger...). In fact neither I nor my children have been able to finish watching the 2nd DVD. I've seldom watched something so slow-paced. I suppose in any case that much of Herriot's humour comes from exaggeration and choice of words, and that's probably next to impossible to render on screen..."

The opening title sequence was cheesy. Some the acting was cheesy except for Viggo Mortensen. Leatherface wasn't that scary in this movie, he was a million times more scary in the original and its 2003 remake and the 2006 prequel. It could have been better. The trailer was kinda cool though. This is a very underrated movies and it deserves it. The ending made no sense when Ken Fore's character died by Leatherface in the pond and had his head cut off by the chainsaw. Then he came back to life at the end and we see that it was only a little cut on his head. Wow this is so unrealistic. If you got your head cut off by a chainsaw you are not just gonna get a small cut your gonna be bleeding very bad! And another thing that was stupid about this movie is that it's a hole new family in this movie. It's not the same family of cannibals from the original Chainsaw Massacre. What is the deal with that? Leatherface can't get adapted. And wow there is only so many cannibalistic families in Texas! Give me a break! And another ridiculous thing about this movie is that it's called part 3 and it's the same plot as the original. It's more of a remake. All the Chainsaw Massacre movies all have the same plot."

It takes good writers to pull off sick humour with it being funny and not just plain rubbish, and obviously the ""2 of the 6 retarded writers for scary movie"" didn't have a clue.

How come none of the other 200 passengers on the other three airliners were reported making cellphone calls? The cellphone calls were vital on Flight 93 to get the details of the ""hero"" legend across, which would then be used by the Pentagon as a recruiting campaign for invading Iraq. Because they were impossible, there would be no billing paperchase in the case of an independent inquiry, but enough people believed they could work to start a war. Now they make a movie to persuade people it was all possible.<br /><br />That Todd Beamer phone call, the one where he is supposed to have said ""Let's Roll"" -- that was not made to his pregnant wife.

Even his wife was stunned that he was supposed to have recited the Lord's Prayer and Psalm 23 --- read her ghost-written book, where she admits just that. They only called to tell her about her husband's call after a full working week had elapsed --- Monday morning to Friday night.<br /><br />And the cockpit voice recording that was miraculously found, it was totally useless for establishing what happened.

Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair. <br /><br />The real problem is that almost all of the sketches go on way past the point of being funny. There seems to be some need to spoof a complete film, so in Skateboarders from hell we get a climatic funeral scene that isn't very funny and destroys the laughs that the film had generated with the ""biker"" fight. There is no reason that this film needed to be almost two hours long since tighter cutting could have made this a classic.<br /><br />Worth seeing if you run across it on cable and you're in the mood for a very uneven comedy.It would be also okay to get in the bargain bin at the 99 cent store (which is how I got my copy) since its not worth more than a dollar."

One positive point: the use of authentic Greek words like ""Kala"" (which actually means ""good"") and ""Econ"" (the root of the word ""economy"" or ""home"")."

As if.<br /><br />They want me to write some more. I will. Don't waste your time on this tripe. The whole movie I was just hoping for the characters to die."
41140_0,"How crushing, to be confronted with irrefutable proof that naked people singing and dancing aren't REALLY enough, per se, to make a film entertaining. Who'd have thought? Unfortunately, if those naked people are singing and dancing in something like ""Waiting for Guffman"" without the parody, it gets tragic. The movie's a broad spoof that winks at itself, actually it pretty much elbows itself in the ribs and guffaws, unlike the audience, which is likely sitting there furtively checking its collective watch every few minutes. The nudity is entirely wholesome and non-pornographic, Cindy Williams is cute and very funny, a couple of the production numbers are clever, and the plot and dialogue just reek. The whole thing would appear to have started out as a terrifically cute stage play, sabotaged on its way to the screen by compromise, timidity, and tired schtick. Still, as with everything in life, there is a lesson to be learned here; in this case, the novel truth that it's possible to be far more embarrassing in clothes than out of them. <br /><br />"
41186_0,"I was browsing thru the screen credits for Laura Flynn Boyle and noticed she had a bit part in this mess. And then I read a comment that this mini-series was ""great"" and that the user couldn't understand why this was never shown again. Maybe because this series was vapid, vacuous, boring and incoherent! Who told Kris Kristoffersen he could act?! He does his best to obfuscate an already muddled plot with his usual mumbling double talk. Somehow Kris has done something (or failed to do something) that allows the Russians to take over. No real explanation is ever given. If the Russians were forced to watch this mess, they would turn tail and run! The only good part of this show is the execution of Congress! (Of course, a funnier execution is the Martian one in ""Mars Attacks!"") . Avoid this show at all costs!"
41230_0,"The book was told from the viewpoint of Black Beauty, and focused primarily on what happened to him and the other animals. If there's any story that demands talking animals, then it's this one. While they didn't have CGI back in the 1970s, they could have done something similar to Mr. Ed.<br /><br />This show suffers from a major change in focus from the book. It's not about Black Beauty. It's about the humans in the story, plus some extra characters they threw in.<br /><br />It's like making a show or movie based on the novel Traveller by Richard Adams and having it focus on General Lee.<br /><br />The show was pretty, and the acting was good, but I can't give this show a good rating. A show supposedly based on the novel should actually be about Black Beauty, not about the parade of humans that passed through his life."
41276_0,"Spoiler****Holy cow that movie was so sad. The acting was horrible, the editing was sloppy, the story did not flow, and well no one would really believe that could happen. The only good acting that happened was when Nurse Washington knew she was going to die and just had to make her loss felt. The editing in this movie was horrid. In the very beginning we see the president being shot with a dart then the next we see a woman talking on her cell phone. I thought someone had taped another movie over the movie I had started to watch. The movie was a mess mostly because of the subplot they tried to have going on, which involved a romantic interest between the virologist and the president. The virologist gets infected with the virus and does not have to wear the containment suit, and to that she says 'Well now I can do this' to the president. Not that, that was bad enough the story line was not even believable. The whole thing with the virus being airborne and then the general cutting a hole in the containment shield which contaminates the whole area outside of the hospital. Then the brilliant general decides to blow up the hospital because then the virus would be gone. But what really would happen is the airborne virus would then be able to travel farther because the bomb disperses particles over the area. Also the ending was abominable with only two minutes before the bomb goes the doctor has to find the little boy with the cure, kill the villain, and inform the general that she has the cure. With only two seconds to spare she tells the general that she has the boy and all he has to do to turn off the bomb is push one button while it took at least three to set the bomb."
41320_0,"As no one has yet commented on this piece of trash I think it is my civic duty to warn people not to be tempted by the title into watching this. It is not a horror movie. There is no tension, no frights and very little gore, and that is badly done. I know Ulli Lommel has produced some of worst movies in history but this surpasses even those god awful efforts. Maybe Lommel's parents are to blame for encouraging him or maybe he's just some spoilt rich kid with more money than sense but either way, he should stop making films immediately. I believe the movie is taken from a book called ""Diary of a Cannibal"". I'm intrigued enough by the awfulness of the film to seek out this book and see if it is better. It must be.The entire movie is made up of flashbacks that are, more often than not, repeated over and over. The whole thing looks like it was shot through the bottom of a jam jar and the main actors do nothing of consequence throughout the whole turgid 80 minutes or so. If somebody offers ""Cannibal"" to you for free, don't take it. Just walk away because you will, most surely, regret the experience for the rest of your life."
41366_0,"It's been a weird day. My air conditioner went belly up and I sought refuge from the 100+ degree heat at my local mega-multi-plex, buying a ticket to the ""Bourne movie"". After 20 minutes of that movie's self-conscious unsteady-cam filming technique I was feeling a little queasy and bailed. Stopping at ""Bratz"" to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag. What I saw was a totally empty theater (zero people) just two weeks after the movie's release.<br /><br />I couldn't find much similarity between the teen actresses and the dolls (the dolls are all a lot cuter). What strikes me as interesting is not the content of the movie but the fact that it was given a wide theatrical release. The inventory of films must be pretty low if they have to send this anywhere but direct to video. <br /><br />As already pointed out this is ""the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly- acted movie of this year"", or maybe any year. It also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and make-up. They must be serious girly-girls, your soccer and softball playing daughters won't find anything to relate to here. <br /><br />But I'm not sure if the complaints about the message behind the film are really valid. It revolves around four multi-ethnic BFF teen girls who have nothing in common except their fashion trend value systems. Now this would be bad if the characters were played by beautiful young actresses in a school full of gorgeous likewise beautiful girls with perfect bodies. Which is what you expect from the standard pre-sold teen movie. But instead Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) look ready to pledge a dogs, pigs, and elephants sorority. For a while I thought I was watching an episode of ""Animal Planet"". Meredith (Chelsea Staub) was a pleasant exception in this school's bovine to canine parade.<br /><br />They look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland. Whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant? Of course acting skills were just as irrelevant in these casting choices. Which leads to the obvious question of how a group of people so average looking and so clueless about the thespian profession happened to all wonder onto the set of this movie looking dazed and confused. The point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie. The producers have unintentionally managed the positive message that no amount of expensive clothes, shoes, hair, and make- up can make an average girl look like a hot teen actress.<br /><br />Speaking of wandering on to the set looking dazed and confused, Jon Voight plays Meredith's father and the school principal. Now I realize that the highlight of Voight's recent career is a ""Seinfeld"" cameo and his teeth marks on a pencil, but appearing in this mess is the equivalent of Bela Lugosi working with Ed Wood in the 1950's to support his drug habit.<br /><br />The movie concludes with a loud and irritating musical number which I suspect was inspired by the success of ""High School Musical"". <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
41410_0,"A maintenance crew headed by Tom Sizemore goes into an abandoned hospital to look for old equipment to sell to collectors. But a multi-millionaire has a scientist in the catacombs under the hospital, who has developed a serum to cause rapid regeneration and cellular growth. The scientist, who has taken the serum, is finding the results to be a bit more extreme than expected.<br /><br />For my beef with 235 films (who produced this), see my review for ""The Mad"". This film's selling point was easy to identify as soon as I picked it up: it has Tom Sizemore in it. And, hey, I like Tom Sizemore (rent ""Lock Up"" with Sylvester Stallone) so this seems like something worth checking out.<br /><br />That selling point is about as far as you can get with this one. You have a very one-dimensional millionaire who survives a fire. A creature in a tunnel who becomes part rat and part dog. A bum who is apparently a Rastafarian. These things mix well, surprisingly, but only in the most absurd sense of the word ""well"". It's just a lot of strange things going on.<br /><br />The crew's background is in makeup, and it shows. There is a scene where they chop off a guy's fingers that was alright, and the creature is especially slimy. But the creature is just poorly conceived: in horror, there needs to be a balance of how much you do and do not show a monster. Here, they couldn't decide to show him too little (much of the film is almost pitch black) or too much (making him seem somewhat dumb).<br /><br />I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this film. I did. But the actors were nothing special, I didn't care about the characters, and Sizemore is either doped up or washed up in this film. Maybe he's not doped up. But whatever the case, he just looked old and tired. I can't have my hero looking like he wants to drink a six-pack of Coors Original (the Banquet Beer), smear Dorito orangeness on his chest and pass out watching NASCAR. This Sizemore didn't even have enough energy in him to pass gas.<br /><br />I guess this isn't really telling you what you need to know, but there's really nothing to know: bad hero, weak monster, fake secondary characters. Unless your goal is to just get drunk or high and need something on the screen to move every so often, this isn't going to thrill you. If you want a good underground monster, rent ""Tremors"" or ""CHUD""."

I am a new father and have a 3.5 month son who happened to be with his mother at the time. The ending to this movie was the most disturbing thing I have seen in any recent movie I can think of. In fact it was so horrifying that I had to see my son ASAP. Please, if you are new parent, do not watch this. I can handle the most gruesome of movies but this, hit to close to home and just haunted me. Honestly, the movie was well done and it was a great performance by Shue.

41546_0,"There are bad movies, then there are truly bad movies. Then there is a lower level of cinematic excrement to which Cold Fish belongs. This pitiful excuse of a film is primarily let down by the actors. The lead played by Jon-Paul Gates (no - I have never heard of him either!) has the charisma and screen presence of a house brick. His dismal wooden acting is not the only thing to make you squirm in this film - wait till you have to endure the 'baddies'! Two more names we've never heard of (I can't imagine why) Conrad Asquith and Nadia Straham play a couple of performance artists who like to shock their audience by showing footage of executions. This in turn gave the director of Cold Fish the excuse to show us the self-same footage. This was cheap and exploitative. I don't think it's the place of popular cinema to use real newsreel footage of executions to titillate the audience. But back to Nadia Straham, who obviously based her performance on the ""Rocky Horror Show"" as she clearly was from Transylvania, if her accent was anything to go by. This is for British audiences only - but if I tell you that this film also stars Christopher Biggins - and he gives an almost academy award winning performance compared to the leads in this film - then I think you will start to comprehend that this is a complete waste of 91 minutes of your life. There is a reviewer on this page who has given 3 glowing reviews of this film. I can only imagine that he has invested in the film or is related to one of the actors. British cinema is capable of outstanding work - sadly this sorry fare makes the UK a laughing stock."
41591_0,"This film started promisingly, and for about the first 35 minutes was full of riotously funny humour - but then, it appears that the scriptwriters just ran out of the ideas - So what did they do? They just repeated the same old ones over and over and over again to the point of tedium, where you can see the jokes long before they arrive.<br /><br />A pretty girl walks past Kevin and Perry - and you just wait for one of them to get an erection for the hundredth time - the same joke was done better in Waynes World (schhhhwing!). A few laughs are saved for the last 5 minutes or so, but this just looked like a what would have been funny as a 30 minute TV show, padded and stretched into a movie.<br /><br />In the UK, this film has been rated '15', which is a shame as a sizeable proportion of the audience that would most likely appreciate the schoolboy humour is too young to see it at the cinema - They'll probably catch it on TV sooner or later, which is where this film belongs."

Gibson Rickenbacker, Fender Tremolo, Marshall Strat, Roland Pick...GIVE ME A BREAK!!<br /><br />Okay, now that that's out of the way, this film is pure cheeze. Non-stop cheddar from beginning to end. The thinnest of plots, the background is so shallow you need a helmet to wade through it...and the acting is *horrible*!! Not that I expected much from a Van Damme film, but COME ON!!! Vincent Klyn can barely put two syllables together! It amazes me that he could even get through his lines! (And what's with that outfit?

If you want to see Van Damme that's even *close* to worth watching, skip this one and rent Hard Target (GO JOHN WOO!!), Kickboxer or Bloodsport. 3/10."

41726_0,"Pretty dull. Some somewhat Argentoesque aspects, like the opening, which seems like a flashback (it's not) and a long tracking shot. Psycho hangs over this film more obviously, though, with a sinister mother character, a wimpy young man, voyeurism - and a psychoesque murder, as well as music clearly stolen from Psycho's shower scene.<br /><br />Some memorable images, but an unmemorable film unworthy of a second viewing.<br /><br />My reasoning for seeing it was a bit odd. I recall having seen in the late 1970s or early 1980s an advertisement/public service announcement, promo, or trailer of some kind on TV. This would almost certainly have been network TV, since we didn't have cable. Camera was zooming in going up a narrow white staircase, I believe there was a heartbeat on the soundtrack, and the camera might have zoomed in on a vent on one of the walls in the staircase. I believe there was a voice-over saying something about a ""silent scream."" Visually, that's all it was - camera zooming up a staircase.<br /><br />I thought it was possible, and it was also suggested to me on either IMDb's I Need to Know or Horror message boards, that this was a trailer for Silent Scream (1980). However, there was not a staircase like that in the movie, and unfortunately no trailer was included on the video. For some reason, I also wonder if it could have been a fire safety promo, or an antiabortion ad.<br /><br />So, even though I'm not keen to watch the movie again, I would like to see the TV trailers for it!"
41771_0,"I watched this movie twice. Once without any preview or knowledge of the plot. The second time listening to the commentary from the producer and the director. I do understand that the movie had a lot of problems with financing and script re-writes. I also understand that they had problems just getting all of the scenes that they needed to complete the picture. With that said, I really didn't feel that this movie was anything greater than a made for cable movie.<br /><br />I read about the glaring errors in other posts, but to me, the most obvious was the acting. I just felt that it wasn't realistic at times. We've all seen the formula girl prison movie before. This movie tacks on another issue not explored in other prison films. If this movie stayed on that issue more and tried not to tackle 4-5 other problems going on in prisons today, I think it would have been a better movie.<br /><br />I really hope they give the director a chance to really direct a picture so I can see what potential she has to offer with an all black female cast. I just wasn't stirred by this film and the disjointed acting and editing was probably the reason why."
41816_0,"Possibly the worst acting ever in a genre not noted for its sterling thespians. Quigley is the best of the lot, shining (relatively) in her role as one of the many disposable sacks of blood in this tedious time-sink. Who lives through it? Who cares? Since the characters are all blanks, there's no suspense and the little interest there is wanes quickly. One of the all-time worst horror films."
41861_0,"You'd have to be a truly unscrupulous and slightly decadent Mexican trash-director in order to take a real-life human tragedy, like that of the plane crash in the Andes, and maximally exploit its storyline and horrific elements. René Cardona Sr. already directed a fairly truthful and impressive re-enactment of the real disaster in 1976 (""Survive!), but apparently his own son was jealous at the money-making concept and decided to make pretty much exactly the same film, only set in a *slightly* warmer climate and with a handful of sharks thrown in for additional menace. The result is a preposterous and severely unpleasant film that falsely aspires to be an intense drama, but actually it's just shameless excuse to depict the mental downfall of people and slowly build up towards cannibalism for the sake of survival. ""Cyclone"" opens with cheerful postcard images of a sunny holiday resort where tourists make boat excursions near the coastline. Then the calamity displayed in the title brutally interrupts the holiday spirit and, for several long minutes, Cardona Jr. simply edits together a compilation of random National Geographic documentary images to illustrate the harshness of the cyclone. Castaways from a tourist excursion and a fisherman's boat, as well as survivors of a sea-crashed plane gather together in a tiny sloop and face several long days of hunger, mental & physical exhaustion, desiccation, hopelessness and of course the inevitably increasing feelings of mutual hatred and competition. If all this painful human suffering isn't enough yet, the waters are also infested with bloodthirsty tiger sharks. After nearly a dozen days of despair, some of the survivors see no other option than to feed on the flesh of the deceased, but this socially sensitive suggestion really tears the group apart. Like I said, ""Cyclone"" is an incredibly unpleasant viewing experience and it hardly appeals to any cinematic target group. The film is far too heavy-toned for horror fanatics but simultaneously it's too uneven to please disaster-film freaks and too repulsive for admirers of dramas. The characters are bleak and the script draws their personalities rather inconsistently. Carroll Baker's character, for example, is initially portrayed as a real bitch that protects her poodle from the burning sun rather than to rescue fellow human beings, but when the climax approaches she suddenly transformed into one of the most amiable people on board. Same problem with Arthur Kennedy's priest character! At first he's comprehensive and helpful, but later it actually seems as if he wants to prevent people from saving themselves. Do not, repeat NOT, raise your expectations too much regarding the shark sub plot. The exact same shark footage is shown no less than four times and, if my memory serves me well, these scenes also already featured in Cardona's other sea-adventure ""Tintorera"". The last half hour of this extremely overlong (120minutes) exploitation ordeal is literally disgusting and actually discouraging for those who were still expecting a happy ending. The gore and bloodshed is shocking, indeed, but you can't possibly neglect the many moments of boredom and the overall execution of ""Cyclone"" is downright tasteless and sick."
41906_0,"Do not listen to anything that someone who has given this movie a positive review has to say: they are lying to you, literally. It is pretty common knowledge amongst the posters of this movie that there is a conspiracy to improve this movies image on IMDb.com. If you look at the rating percentages, there are next to no 8's and 9's, which is a very good and reasonable score for a movie that is as good as some say it is. No, the only significant positive rating that is given is a 10, which makes no sense. Look at the rating history, look at who has commented on it, and look at their post/rating/comment history. It is quite amusing indeed.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it's supporters have one thing right: it's pretty hard to make a movie on the budget that they must have had to make ""13 Seconds"" (which I'm guessing is in the neighborhood of $100). First, it is not at all scary. At no point am I scared, ""creeped out,"" on edge, nervous, or even disgusted. It only affects the viewer's emotion in one way; it makes the viewer angry, angry for having spent the money to have seen it, and angry that you wasted an hour and a half of your life on it. The special effects are very distracting (no, we cannot fault the film makers for this, but it certainly does hinder your watching experience). The acting is horrendous (I'd say bad by high school theater standards). The plot is mediocre at best. And the dialogue is painfully terrible (lines like ""I found this book.""--""is it old?"" and many others make you rewind it to see if you heard what you actually heard). I can, in all honesty and with absolutely no exaggeration, say that this is the worst movie that I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am this strongly critiquing this movie not because I have a grudge against its creators (although I'm not happy about losing 90 minutes and $4). I am critiquing it so that no one else is fooled by what others are posting on this website. This is a terrible movie and is only worth watching if both a)you get it for free (or, even better, are getting paid to see it), and b)you do not value your time at all. No, on second thought, even if those two conditions are met, there are still better things to do. Steer clear, friends. Steer clear."

I understand, from people who have bought this DVD, or a similar version, in the same packaging, that it is a recording of a stage version, which features Kevin Kline, Patricia Routledge, et al, but isn't necessarily the official one. Also, it has Dutch subtitles. The quality isn't good; it's grainy, the colour is insipid and the sound is very low. It's quite probable that it has been recorded from an original NTSC video.

The stars of this movie are John Hodiak as Manuel Cortez and Sylvia Sidney as Cecily Harrington.The premise is the same in both movies. <br /><br />A woman wins a sweepstakes/lottery, drops her boyfriend, and meets Mr Wonderful who sweet talks her, marries her in a short time and prepares to kill her at sometime in the near future at 9:PM.<br /><br />Cecily is the target.

I loved the book its based off of, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and...I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it, and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even as good. They took so many lines from the first movie, Its hard to tell which movie you're watching."
42130_0,"Like many others, I was very interested in this remake of ""The Lathe of Heaven,"" for several reasons. The book by Ursula K. LeGuin is widely regarded as a science-fiction classic, although I have never thought it was among her best work. I read it after I saw the first ""Lathe of Heaven"" on PBS in 1980 and realized that considerable liberties had been taken with the story, although it was much closer to the book than this latest endeavor.<br /><br />Back then, ""Lathe"" was a bold experiment for PBS and the producers: To make an original full-length science-fiction TV movie on a limited budget that would appeal to an audience used to flashier entertainment. Remember, it was only three years since ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" had revitalized screen science fiction, until then very much in the doldrums. The producers of LOH wanted to make a more intimate story than those blockbuster movies, one based more on human relationships. With their low budget, they looked for places and expedients that would transmit their vision. Although the story was set in Portland, Oregon, they filmed a lot of it in Dallas because of that city's more futuristic architecture. I liked it very much and videotaped it, and have the tape to this day. (Unfortunately but inevitably, the tape had deteriorated significantly when I transferred it to DVD at the end of 2006. Never fear, it appears that it's now available on commercial DVD.)<br /><br />It says a great deal about inflation in the movie business that the remake had a ""small"" budget of ""only"" $5 million. That would have been a lot of money for the original filmmakers. I also wonder why here in the States we had to wait until September of 2002 to see it when the first comments about it, from a viewer in Turkey, are from February!<br /><br />But whenever it aired, my reaction would be the same: Why did they bother to make it at all? There is so little of the original here that it is essentially a different work. They have taken the story and drained it of its blood. And what does happen goes beyond problems with temporal discontinuities and paradoxes; these people behave without logic or motivation. It looks like a long episode of the ""new"" Outer Limits or a similar show, one of those low-budget syndicated series that they film in Canada because it's cheaper there, where there is money only for a few sets, a couple of computer graphics, and a lot of talk in closeup (to hide the spareness of the sets). All of the acting and dialogue takes place in murmurs. I usually like James Caan, but it looks like he's been watching Bruce Willis's recent film work and decided to try the minimalist, non-acting approach.<br /><br />Now that I've brought up The Outer Limits, remember how the opening credits used to talk about ""awe and mystery""? Well, if you want awe and mystery, forget about this remake and go back to the 1980 version; it had much more of those qualities."
42176_0,"This movie is a prime example of people being too messed up from the 1960s after taking too much LSD. People are reading way too much into this movie. If this movie was made today it would be panned and dismissed. It is boring beyond belief. You keep waiting for something to occur. Nothing ever does. By the time it ends you are thinking I'm going to kill myself if I have to endure another minute. The acting of Nicholson and Black is above average but you wonder what they saw in choosing to do this horrible script. The comment that this is one of the key films of the 1970s is ludicrous. These are the kind of movies from the 70s that should be forgotten. Give me ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Patton"", ""Godfather"", ""American Graffiti"" or ""Star Wars"". This movie sucks. One great scene does not a movie make."
42220_0,"This movie made me want to kill myself. I loathed every second of it. The only reason why I'm writing anymore about this about this abortion is that IMDb wants at least 10 lines for a review. While watching ""Rocketman"" I was actually concerned my girlfriend would leave me. Anybody associated with this film should be exiled (if not shot). There is almost nothing redeeming about this film. The only part that was remotely enjoyable was Harland Williams losing it over gefilte fish space paste. Also, the movie ends with the unfunny protagonist getting up in the love interest through dancing upside down (because of artificial gravity). I'm nauseous."
42266_0,"I watched this with a dim knowledge of what went on at Bletchley in the second world war. I thought the film coped well with putting the complexity of codebreaking in a viewer-friendly way and accurately portrayed the dynamic of the communication challenges inherent when ""suits"" talk to ""geeks"". <br /><br />That's about the limit of the good things I can say about the way this film delivers its message. It doesn't seem to be able to decide what the important things are and it doesn't help you get behind any of the protagonists' causes. Maybe that was the intent - the plot itself is a bit of an enigma - but I would have preferred a clearer indication of what the protagonists wanted for themselves. You could tell simply from the formula that he would get together with the dowdy female geek, but there was no clear turning point where he overcame his obsessive devotion to his missing ex. <br /><br />A few good moments, but does little to educate and little to really entertain."
42310_0,"As has been said before, this is a really bad Harry Potter installment. Just viewers can throw away Star Wars-Episode I and not miss anything, this Harry Potter film does not have to be purchased and you will not miss anything.<br /><br />This is actually the first movie that I have ever been to where a person near me was actually SLEEPING through most of the movie. Yes, SLEEPING. And snoring. It became actually funny and it slowly sunk into my mind that this movie was a huge load of crap. If you have never read the book, you would be totally confused; If you HAVE read the book, you would not only be totally confused, but you would be really angry that all of the MAJOR PLOT POINTS of the book have been left out.<br /><br />This is a very important lesson for you aspiring filmmakers and screenwriters. Story is king. Story is king. Story is king. Let that stew in your brain before you ever write anything again. Now I don't want to totally eviscerate the screenwriter, Steve Kloves. He has been the screenwriter for most of the series and, so far, has done a pretty good job of converting huge novels into entertaining scripts, so the fault has to lie with the director, David Yates. HP:OOtP was his first HP movie and, at the time, was my worst one. I thought then that the book has been done a disservice. Now my fears are totally realized when this steaming heap of crap came out. It seems to me that David Yates took the screenplay, and said, ""I want to compete with all of the other teeny movies out there, so out go major plot points (teens don't go for all that plot and thinking stuff anyways) and in goes more moody swoon y teeny pablum. After all, I AM the director."" And there, dear aspiring filmmakers, is the when someone needs to take a good piece of hickory and break it across the front of your face, leaving a ""Louisville Slugger"" logo imprinted across your face. Because, YOU screwed up.<br /><br />Now that we have the same two teaming up again for the last movie, get out the Pepto."
42356_0,"Bundle: ""I say Jimmy, shall we go sculling with 37 of our closest friends?"" --------- Jimmy: ""I daresay Bundle, I'd rather be drawn into some international intrigue for the weekend, at our country house.""<br /><br />Pre-war Agatha Christie mysteries are an odd dish. Much like the English Patient, they're thinly-veiled envy-pieces in which readers wish they were as glamorous as the gentry. In this case, it's not sufficient that the protagonists be wealthy, landed, titled and surrounded by boatloads of friends, they also need to find themselves at the center of an international cabal (w/o even getting out of bed), who wear clock-face masks, and generally behave like superheros on behalf of Dear Old Britain. It's like a James Bond family reunion.<br /><br />This yarn leaps from the quaint to the absurd, to the improbable, to the over-extended, finally jumping firmly outside the genre boundaries of 'whodunit.' When the over-scaled conclusion finally arrives, somehow it manages to still be unsatisfying and trifling. Christie hasn't figured out the low-effort formula that would keep her up to her ears in cash yet. Regardless, if the plot drew any excitement, it would be fine. But she's way out of her league here and would rarely try anything this far off course again."
42400_0,"It's amazing what can be done with a low budget film. You can provide work for shoe salesmen to be actors and for plumbers to be directors. I don't know what the budget for this epic flop may have been but I doubt it was more than seven dollars and twelve cents. What part of ""dreadful"" do the producers not understand? I've seen many bad films. I've seldom seen one that so effectively combines bad writing, bad acting, bad production and bad staging. It's appearance on television should have been delayed until (the US) Thanksgiving because few families will be able to manage such a giant turkey,"
42446_0,"As a Bond movie CR fails miserably. It has nothing that a Bond movie should have. It's SLOW, BORING, WITLESS, STORYLESS and utterly unconvincing from a character standpoint.<br /><br />At no point in the movie do we ever care about any character. At no point in the movie do we feel ANY villain is really an evil ""rule the world"" or ""pull off the biggest heist ever"" type of baddie. At no point is ANYTHING sexy. At no point is Bond ever suave, sophisticated, cool, smooth, carefree or even likable.<br /><br />If the whole movie was supposed to lead up to him saying the Bond James Bond line at the end, I want my two hours back.<br /><br />(spoilers) There's zero, nada, none and no chemistry at all between the 'lovers' and its beyond obvious that she is scamming him from the get go. Its excruciatingly dull to watch the ""game"" both at the poker table and between bond and 'the girl' because we all know where its going and its not fun.<br /><br />The movie was so tedious im surprised it survived to screen and wasn't renamed and given an alternate ending so it didn't horribly stain the Bond genre. The only thing slower than the movie was the amount of time it took the venice building to sink scene, Bond to rescue the girl we know is gonna drown scene and for bond to figure out he was being conned the whole time... yeesh!<br /><br />Once again: No evil bad guys, no cool henchmen, no hot chicks, no great chases, no crazy gadgets and no James Bond.<br /><br />There have been some bad Bond movies in the past, but they were bad only because they didn't live up to the standards set by better Bond movies before them. This movie is just BAD and an embarrassment to every Bond movie before it.<br /><br />Like others have said before. If you're hoping for any kind of Bond movie at all, watch one that was made before this one - because despite the title and the lead characters name. James Bond does not appear in this film...<br /><br />ps. the actors don't do a 1/2 bad job with what they were given - but what they were given to work with is NFG. Unless you're hot to see Dan naked and getting his family jewels smashed - skip this mess."
42491_0,"I find this movie a little interesting but very cheesy and boring if you watch it a few times. Also, I like the comedy in the dialog of this movie. If the Heisei series were able to create a movie with 4 monsters instead of two, I would elect Supermechgodzilla and Biollante versus Spacegodzilla and Destroyah. All those monsters can really put up a great fight against Godzilla. It will mainly be Supermechagodzilla versus Spacegodzilla and Biollante versus Destroyah. Godzilla will have to make a miracle to destroy them all. Spacegodzilla's crystal surroundings will make a good ring. It will be action packed with not a lot of human dialog as it would usually have."
42536_0,"Living up to the excellence of Shusuke Kaneko's Death Note films was always going to be a daunting task. The makers of this film responded to this challenge by avoiding it.<br /><br />The film's prominent ties to its predecessors, most notably the inclusion of several characters and events from them, are entirely superficial, and I was left with the distinct impression that Nakata's primary desire was to make a bioterrorism thriller, with the Death Note movies and the character of L serving merely as convenient springboards.<br /><br />After going to the trouble of hiring several actors to reprise their roles, (Such as Erika Toda as Misa, Asaka Seto as Naomi Misora, and Shunji Fujimura) their characters are criminally underused. This is not just lazy, it is cruel. It's the equivalent of dangling food in front of a starving dog only to pull it away after only letting them lick it. Even the unperceptive viewer can tell these are blatant attempts to fake a connection which is essentially nonexistent.<br /><br />The sheer magnitude of neglected opportunities to capitalise on the wealth of plot and character established by the Death Note films is staggering. A event as stupendous as Kira's reign of death would have a lasting effect on society; the Death Note films show the beginnings of this, with people divided over whether his actions were right, and many supporting him to a religious degree. Yet in L: Change the WorLd, its almost as if none of it had ever happened. Life goes on as usual, with scarcely a mention of the monumental upheaval the world has just undergone. This also could've provided many interesting possibilities, such as the Kira cult becoming involved in the plot, or characters such as Misa and Ryuk playing new roles and continuing to develop. Apparently, Nakata couldn't care less.<br /><br />What's more, he can't resist falling back on his roots as a horror director, and is determined to scare the audience with the victims of the virus. Unfortunately, the result is corniness rather than adrenaline. The rest if the time, he's either plodding through the drama on autopilot, or inserting light comedy in a haphazard manner.<br /><br />The writing isn't much better. The script is brimming with trite clichés, yet is oblivious to this and makes no effort to put a fresh spin on them. It has some admirable aspirations, namely its attempts to explore L's human side, and capture the topical issues of terrorism and the Bird Flu/SARS scares in the same way that its prequels addressed justice and the death penalty, but in execution it fails. Overall, it largely plays like amateur fanfiction, overusing the surface strengths of the originals (namely L's eccentricity) while losing its deeper strengths. Interesting ideas are left to rot on a compost heap of generic characters, messy plotting, and lame attempts to emulate the excesses of the typical Hollywood action movie.<br /><br />To his immense credit, Kenichi Matsuyama lifts L above this malaise and squeezes a river of blood from the stony script in his typically witty and charismatic performance. Once again, he embodies the character down to his finest mannerisms, and makes like he just crept off the set of The Last Name. True, his English skills are modest, but this is actually believable; I met many Japanese people who spoke in this way during my time in Japan.<br /><br />Sadly, however, much the use of English throughout the film is reminiscent of the Heisei Godzilla series in its grating inanity. Also, the Japanese performances outside of Matsuyama range from decent, (Fukuda Mayuko as Maki) to downright cheesy. (Most of the villains) Even Erika Toda as Misa had none of the spark Kaneko drew out of her in the prequels during her brief cameo.<br /><br />Even Death Note veteran Kenji Kawai's score, while certainly not bad, is a far cry from his work on the previous films, though largely because he's mostly forcibly limited to low key background music and the long periods of sluggish silence Nakata so adores. He finally finds a chance to shine towards the end, where he provides two impressive pieces; an epic cue that accompanies L's arrival at the climax, and a melancholy piece that fits the fittingly touching conclusion nicely.<br /><br />Cinematography is also a step down, losing the smooth, rich clarity of the Death Note movies for a dry and altogether bland visual style.<br /><br />Thankfully it's not all doom and gloom; there's some good apples among the piles of rotten ones. As mentioned previously, the ending is suitably poignant, though the tears it almost brought to my eyes are due primarily to my love of and familiarity with the character. I also laughed aloud at several of L's displays of quirkiness, and flushed with joy at the rare but delicious moments of Death-Note-style ""intellectual pwnage."" The opening title sequence is slick and classy, capturing the feel of its predecessors wonderfully.<br /><br />The FX are strong for a Japanese film, and are actually slightly more advanced than those of the first two films. The destruction of the infected village is vivid and impressive, and the practical effects for virus's symptoms are mostly well done. Ryuk's execution via CGI during his brief appearance is about on par with his previous incarnations.<br /><br />But you know something's wrong when your counting the good moments rather than the bad ones.<br /><br />In the end, the film's highlights are like sweet chocolate chips in a bitter and mouldy cookie. It succeeds as fanservice and as cold commercial calculation, but fails as art, entertainment, or storytelling. It's an awful shame, because with the ingredients left by its marvellous predecessors, it could have been truly great."
42581_0,In the scene where the brothel explodes I am wondering (as it wasn't released in New Zealand where this scene and others were shot) if they flash or pan to people watching the brothel explode as I was an extra cast as a guy walking home in dark trousers and white shirt.<br /><br />We weren't told the plot but that there was only going to be ONE take on the explosion shot and no one was to 'act like a hero' or do what they weren't supposed to do.<br /><br />Finally (I got there at 11.30pm) but the scene with the explosion wasn't shot at 3.45am sheesh I was tired but it was fun! As I live in NZ I've never been able to rent it so didn't see if I was 'centre stage' in reaction to the explosion of the brothel.<br /><br />Any one shed some light on this???

In fact, the opening sequence of the bears emerging from their den is remarkably similar...<br /><br />The storyline is contrived and the references to changing climate blatantly obvious.<br /><br />It truly is sad that these magnificent animals die, but that's the essence of the natural world, right? Some animals prey on others, climate changes in natural cycles. Polar bears survived the last stint of global warming just fine. The ice sheets were so small 1000 years ago that crops could be grown in Greenland. Wine grapes were grown in England. Where were the polar bears then? This movie was not nearly as good as ""March of the Penguins"". I came away from that movie inspired. I came away from this one wanting to gag."
42761_0,"Fred Dryer stars as a gung ho marine who rounds up the troops and conducts a rescue mission in response to the U.S government's underwhelming response to his commanding officer's(Brian Keith) abduction. Of course it is the Arabs who are behind it and basically this is jingoism at it's most hideously lame. The movie has an interesting cast (Brian Keith, Joanna Pacula, Paul Winfield and Sasha Mitchell) but all of these counterparts are mainly wasted in favor of Fred Dryer's charisma-less performance which consists of grunting and looking deeply ticked off. The movie seems to live in a timeless vortex where repetition rules the day. Everything about the movie is tired and clichéd but the details are so groan inducingly lame and so absurd you just keep rolling your eyes in disdain. All of this would be enjoyable had Death Before Dishonor contained some punch in the action sequences but unfortunately these one sided action sequences feature a three digit body count on one side, while only one good guy dies. At this type of ratio, it is no wonder the movie went into obscurity.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)"
42806_0,"I keep falling for the same crap.... Renting a movie that looks well-done on a tight budget by a first time director or someone new to the scene.

I keep looking for the next sleeper hit and I keep reading the reviews given by extras on the set or others involved with the movie saying it was the greatest movie ever made, blah, blah, blah. I am an idiot! I am going to wait longer to for the REAL reviews to come out (much like this one).

But I guess I was a little surprised by this flick.<br /><br />I'll do my best not to give anything away here: the first 40 minutes I found entertaining and downright creative. After that though...it took something of a downward spiral.<br /><br />I got the feeling several times in this film, that when the writers reached a crossroads as to where the plot should turn next, they just said, ""F*ck it. What's the most outlandish thing we could do?"" Well, what this resulted in was a crappy, discontinuous film with a horrible, horrible ending.<br /><br />This film had some potential to begin with, but ultimately I wouldn't waste your time with this one. A movie with a bad ending like this one is kind of like trying Pepsi One: The concept is intriguing, and at first it doesn't seem half-bad. But the horrible aftertaste left in its wake ultimately doesn't make it worth trying in the first place. Wow! How's that for a simile? 4/10<br /><br />Go Sun Devils!"
42987_0,I should have walked out. It started bad and it never improved. The actors completely overplay their roles and the added smart alec isn't this fun cuts doesn't seem convincing. While the movie have a few good ideas they are consistently badly implemented and the timing and acting doesn't do it any favours. <br /><br />I think you will have to be American or the long time owner of a mustache to laugh of this one... It is that special kind of no fun humor that only really appeals to yanks. You know where everything is so obvious and overstated that any fun that could have been is thoroughly eliminated by overstating every point of the joke.
43030_0,"I only have a few things to say about the film itself and then a personal conviction about Park as a director. The art direction of the film was absolutely horrible. The staging, color coordination and whatever else went into making this movie was alienating at best. The dialogue was very weak despite everyone's love of quoting Park's previous works. Finally, I feel that there was an unusual amount of campy scene work for this film, even for Park's standards(in particular the angelic halo scene in the prison). Park Chanwook has proved time and time again that he lacks any sense of social responsibility as a director. His only tricks seem to be the incorporation of eery or alienating imagery...If you think very carefully about his work you will realize that it is shallow at best...it plays only on reactions to the reprehensible. His non-revenge films are even weaker in content and style and have received an undue amount of praise and accolade."
43076_0,"Randolph Scott is a former Confederate soldier and Joan Bennett plays a woman who refuses to admit when the Civil War is over in James Hogan's cattle rustling epic, which looks and feels in retrospect a lot like a B version of Howard Hawks' ""Red River."" There's a general lack of ambition here and the movie doesn't add up to much, just a formula picture that pretends to be somewhat more important than a singing cowboy picture.<br /><br />Anytime Randolph Scott is wearing more makeup in the movie than Joan Bennett, that's a sign of trouble right there. Scott annoyed me to no end in this movie, and it's hard to believe he's the same man who became such a convincing western star in the 50s and 60s. The director is partly to blame, because he's always having Scott do these clownish double takes to the camera that really do not suit him. You shouldn't ask actors to do things that they really can't do. Joan Bennett is mis-cast because she feels too contemporary. Walter Brennan basically stole the movie and made a couple good scenes out of it. I wouldn't be surprised if Hawks did see the movie and figure he could do it better. The following year after this film, Brennan made a memorable appearance in Fritz Lang's ""Fury,"" and shortly after that he began his memorable run of character performances for Hawks. So this film might if anything be somewhat important in terms of Brennan's filmography, since he basically proves here that he's even better than Gabby Hayes.<br /><br />May Robson is also very amusing as ""Granna"", the ancient frontier woman who won't be left behind and who nurses a maternal affection for the aging Brennan character. Robert Cummings plays the rival love interest for Joan Bennett, a smarmy Confederate dead ender who dreams of leading rebel excursions from Mexico to reclaim Texas. B western regular Raymond Hatton also puts in a patented supporting performance as some kind of wilderness man to round up the rather generic but pleasant nature of the cast and film generally.<br /><br />Not much else to say here. Hogan's direction is pedestrian and the story is somewhat interesting but very contrived. For instance, when the uber-annoying regional bureaucrat (Robert Barrat) is murdered rather obviously in the midst of a fray by Scott's trapping buddy (Hatton), the military officer in charge (Harvey Stephens) barely bothers to investigate and suddenly switches plans and agrees to help the ranchers. It's all tied up in such a way as to soothe the frayed nerves between the Southerners and the Northerners, as if this was some piece of propaganda delayed by some 60 odd years. There's a couple shoot-outs against Indians but nothing really invested with any drama or meaning. Violence in this movie is simply action, and not very good action. Basically the movie would suffice for Saturday morning but it seems to want to be at least a bit more than that, and fails."
43120_0,"I bought this movie on a pure whim of decent premise. The back eludes to neither pro or anti-bush, and even quotes how it's made for ""thinkers"".

Questions riddled my head, ""wonder what Chaney would do much different?"", ""how would the U.S. really respond?"", ""what would become of Bush's course of actions?"", ""what would happen in 2008? 2018? 2050?"", ""how would the rest of the world view this?"". <br /><br />But forget all that, you're set on a journey of 30% anti-Bush protests news clips before death, 60% forensic ""whodunit"", 10% no freedom wagon.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie is overwhelmingly anti-Bush with the only pro-remarks coming from his speech writer (all mainly personal, not political). Second, this is NOT a political movie, it's a murder mystery you don't care about because it didn't happen. <br /><br />Even when it mentioned Chaney moving up to presidency I perked up for a moment, as if the opening credits ended and the movie were about to begin, but no, no, back to some fictional trial with a bunch of malarkey about evidence. It's fictional, make overwhelming evidence, make the assassin found dead, and give us a political yarn to unravel.<br /><br />This movie deserves to be protested, shot, then put on fictional trial before we all come together and whine about crappy movies."
43166_0,"This, the final episode, was perhaps one of the biggest disappointments I have seen on-screen to date.<br /><br />The episode's premise was promising: Mulder, on trial for the murder of a man who cannot die, depends upon Skinner and Scully to back him up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what was a good idea quickly degenerated into a parade of characters from the show's better seasons, throwing in Krycek, Gibson Praise, Marita Covarrubias, etc. for no discernible reason except as a poorly-contrived...what? Plot point? It's like a clip episode only so, so much worse.<br /><br />Then Mulder's on the run, Scully joins him, Krycek throws Smoking Man--who, by the way, has been hiding at an ancient Anasazi village?????--down some stairs and (apparently) kills him, and the episode ends with Mulder and Scully in a motel room, on the lam, with all their allies dead or wanted by the FBI. None of the fans' questions are answered (nor hardly addressed), and the whole thing has a very confused, ""I'm-sick-of-this, let's-get-it-over-with"" feel to it. There was so much potential, even after the last three seasons of pure garbage, and it was squandered.<br /><br />Le sigh, the fans now must content themselves with watching Seasons 1 through 6 and hoping that, should Chris Carter make another movie, he dismisses Seasons 7, 8 and 9 as a drugged dream sequence. That would be the only honorable thing to do, seeing as how horribly he mangled this would-be happy ending."

A group of hunters discovers these eggs, and two of them hatch into aliens. One alien goes on a murderous rampage, while the other, who was taken by a local boy as an egg, grows up to be a sweet, kind thing.

43256_0,"CGI has to be one of the worst things to happen to cheap movie-making! Now instead of silly special effects we get Playstation Graphics on the various creatures in every cheap monster movie. The Marabunta Ants are no exception! From far away they look like little black dots that are moving in perfection synchronization. Up close, they look like big plastic ants that you can buy at the Dollar Store in those fake bug bags. Someone writing in another review pointed out that the actors keep getting the names of the little kid mixed up, and it is true! The Indian guy is also Grey Wolf or Red Wolf depending on when they are talking to him. And how about a giant ant hill where people sink into it but there are no ants?? Three people sank into that ant hill, and last time I saw an ant hill, the ants at least come out; especially when they are eating full-sized humans. Does anyone remember ""THEM"" which is a great ant movie?? Well, THEM used flame-throwers to kill the ants, and that was cool. Here, the ento-moronologist rigs a flame thrower from some kind of toilet bowl cleanser and an enema bag, and the flame is about the same as you can get from any cigarette lighter. The guy lights up his flame thrower (with a tiny little flame) and then from the ground going upwards a flame covers the screen!!! What a bogus effect, especially since you can still see the guy's flame thrower in the background and the little tiny flame on the tip!!! Meanwhile, the entomologist's teacher-friend is shooting the ants with an air gun. NO DUH!!! For real, an air gun! Except she claims she is using magnesium bullets, which in theory should burn like a flare gun. However, in the movie, she is shooting away at the ants, and they keep showing where she is shooting and absolutely nothing happens!!! Apparently somebody forgot to add some kind of CGI smoke or fire. Meanwhile, as the two idiots are walking around the ant logs oblivious to the thousands of ants creeping up on them; their friend in the helicopter is getting eaten alive! Funny that the ants attack a guy on a helicopter and yet the two dorks who are on foot somehow get ignored while they are sticking their hands into ant larvae (looks like rice-pudding) and kicking over the logs which are presumably the center of the community. Marabunta is basically the poorest, dumbest, and most pathetic ant movie ever made. It is an insult to ants everywhere, and to the memory of ""THEM"" which is a 50 year old movie that had better special effects than this horrible turkey."
43300_0,"I've finally been able to see what Satin City/Universal Studios did to Red Dwarf in 1992 for the US. There were actually two pilots, which makes things a bit confusing for everyone. I was able to only see Pilot #1 but I researched Pilot #2 to give some background about it as well. I will try to lay everything down in small bits.<br /><br />Pilot #1 had a male Cat, a clean shaven Lister and Kryten. Of course, taking the plot from the UK pilot, entitled ""The End"". I did get a few chuckles out of this pilot but I shook my head in sorrow the rest of the time.<br /><br />Pilot #2 had some recasting as well as a different general plot altogether. This time the writers took ideas from the UK episodes of `Backwards' `Terrorform' and `Parallel Universe' and used them in a style ala `Tikki to Ride' recapped `Out of Time'. This premise would've been a better start. I never saw it, but I read some scripts and saw some pictures from it. It was sounding better, but not by much.<br /><br />*** Spoiler Alert ***<br /><br />My thoughts about Pilot #1 are as follows. The UK music would've been just fine for the beginning theme of the US version; Todd Rundgren's version was more like elevator music. The adaptation of Kryten was just to give the show flavour and nothing much more. Recapping the premise at the end of the episode makes people feel stupid, especially throwing in bogus footage from the UK series. The part of Lister was out of place; Lister is smeggy and always should be - where's the cigarette smoking, curry eater we love? The set was way too functional and futuristic for the 22nd century, especially for an old mining ship. They should've casted Mac MacDonald as the Captain, at least for the pilot. You can clearly see Craig Charles' face in the mask while painting the F in Red Dwarf in the beginning. The opening minutes, the overview should've been done with a bit more charm; having a guy talk about his sex life isn't a good start on a premise, especially in a command room setting. I didn't like the Battlestar Galactica feel to it. The graphics were actually worse, though it sounds impossible, than the UK version; this does include the credits. Finally the corny jokes, the general atmosphere and the canned laughter were the biggest issues of mine.<br /><br />My thoughts about Pilot #2 are as follows. They should've kept their first choice as Rimmer instead of using Anthony Fuscle, who looks way too muscular and not weasely enough. This pilot version also gives life to a female cat who is not at all like the UK version; instead, Terry Farrell, was casted as courageous and sharp-witted - obviously casted as a sex object. Kryten is in this version as well; I can't say anything bad about Robert. They used a lot of clips from Pilot #1 and the BBC version, which in my mind was not a good idea; starting fresh would've given them a better chance at selling the idea.<br /><br />The scripts for this premise were rewrites of the originals from the BBC with all the best parts taken to make a full episode. They would've had a lot less material overall and only could've done about 2-3 seasons rather than eight series, like the BBC version.<br /><br />In my opinion, instead of trying to mesh something like this for American audiences, they should sell the original Red Dwarf - Season by Season - to Sci-Fi or Comedy Central in the US. This would give true fans of comedy, or Sci-Fi, a great piece of work that entertains millions of people overseas, including Prof. Stephen Hawking and Patrick Stewart. I believe in 1992 there was no Comedy Central or Sci-Fi - but there was a USA Network; that would've had a great spot to run these on a nightly schedule around 11pm, right between two episodes of Wings.<br /><br />As for this version, I will give it an overall rating of 2/10, mainly for the idea. However there was no originality. A rule of thumb is that the concept should never change, even if the idea is ported overseas."
43346_0,The movie started off really good with the diamond robbery then the film takes you to a lot of different places like flipping through a comic book which was quite irritating. Paresh Rawal & Johnny Lever were not really that funny as they usually are but Chunkey Pandey was the way he speaks was so funny that I was killing myself with laughter every time he spoke. Arbaaz Khan was the best in the whole film especially in the scene where he was threaten everyone to get the diamond with a crossbow and was wearing sunglasses. Ayesha Takia was looking beautiful & her acting was cute but the rest of the cast were not impressive and Viveik Oberoi is better off in negative roles because his acting in Shootout in Lokhandwala was terrific. The story is similar to Awara Paagal Deewana e.g. comic thriller about everyone after diamond/s. Overall it's OK to be watched once by rent or if it's on TV or something but not the kind of film to be bought on DVD. The only two good songs are Tere Layee & Yeh Dooriyaan.
43391_0,"Starting with the positive: X is pretty to look at and has a great premise - the two opposing sides that make up the narrative have valid reasons for doing what they do, rather than the ""we're good and they're evil"" style of anime plot writing that is very common. Try as I might, those are the only redeeming features of this movie.<br /><br />X may be an incomplete manga series at the time of filming, but that doesn't mean you can release an incomplete film. Trying to squeeze too much into X has meant that a lot of it doesn't have any point - while the characters are easily distinguishable in terms of their powers, they don't do enough to actually mean anything to the audience. The narrative just runs along at breakneck speed, hoping to distract the audience through constant fight scenes. While I appreciated the mortality rate of the characters in X (as opposed to the cliches of being beaten down to a pulp but then coming back and winning) it was just like watching meat through a grinder - I didn't care when they went in and didn't care when they came out.<br /><br />The metaphysical imagery of X is also very peculiar, mixing a lot of Christian iconography with rivers of blood and gore. It was something different, but different doesn't mean good in this case.<br /><br />My final gripe was that the closest thing this movie had to a twist was simply unbelievable. It flew in the face of what little characterization had been created, then the film ends not with a bang but with a half-hearted sigh. It left me wondering if I had missed something vital, but not caring to endure a repeat performance. <br /><br />Pretty but very pointless, X wasn't worth the rental."
43436_0,"I happened across this film on the 'World Movies' channel, coincidentally the day after I read Murakami's story (in 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Women'). I really liked the story. So much so that after the first half-hour of the film, I was reading it again, trying to use the book to block out the TV screen. What is the point of this movie? Wait, movie? It isn't really a movie at all, if your requirements for movies go beyond 'being on film'. This is a children's picture-book version of the story. This is the movie's process: Recite the story, almost verbatim, and play tracking shots ad nauseum over the monologue, showing banal instances of what the monologue is saying. Tony and the girl move in together? Lets show her pouring milk! Wife obsessed with clothes? Lets show her wearing clothes! Hell, lets show her, in consecutive tracking shots, wearing SEVERAL DIFFERENT outfits! That'll really drive the point home, that she's a clothes addict. Oh, and don't forget to have a lonely, melancholy piano constantly playing behind the monologue. Because everything's GOT TO BE MELANCHOLY! AND LONELY! God knows we've got no possible other way to convey that, besides the monologue. What do you think we are, filmmakers?!<br /><br />However, I have advice for the director: Go back to 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman', and try to adapt 'A Poor Aunt Story'. If you can manage to do that one in the same way you did this one, I'll chain myself to the Eureka Tower, and refuse to come down until you've won the Golden Palm. I have advice for potential viewers, too: The story is just over 20 pages long. You can read it in a quarter of the time it would take to watch this slide-show/movie. And it's even got some humour in it, too. Not everything has to be MELANCHOLY."
43481_0,"Scared To Death has the unfortunate distinction of being my least favorite Bela Lugosi movie. To say the movie is bad is an understatement. It features a plot so lame that you don't care that you don't understand it. If you don't want this horrible film ruined for you, don't read any further! In a nutshell someone is scaring a woman to death and it turns out not to be any of the characters in the movie. It features the absolute worst character acting I have ever seen including a half-witted rentacop and a sadistic male chauvinist reporter and his dingy girlfriend. <br /><br />Of course, when Bela Lugosi is on camera the movie becomes interesting. Bela is in good form as a hypnotist/magician and of course he gives it his all in this dismal movie that is too long at 59 minutes. Some of the problem lies in the fact that as a Bela Lugosi movie, Lugosi gets far too little screen time. The script gives too much stage time to these very egregious and tedious characters and seems to feature the Lugosi character only because they *had* to fit him in somewhere.<br /><br />Bela Lugosi gives a great performance as always, I am not sure if even that is capable of redeeming this movie -- especially when the nagging thought kept running through my head that surely someone could have found something better for this great actor to do than this drek. Bela is healthy and strong and powerful and I daresay still sexy here -- why was he being wasted? What great talents are being wasted in such a fashion today? But I digress.<br /><br />I don't recommend this film to any but the die-hard Lugosi fan or the connoisseur of truly bad cinema. It is almost painful to watch Bela Lugosi a skilled artist playing on such a taudry canvas. <br /><br />As a side note Scared to Death was Bela Lugosi's only movie filmed in color. (Which actually gives one a reason to watch it, I suppose). I'm going to have to look again more closely, but apparently Bela Lugosi had . . . green eyes! Or are they blue?"
43526_0,"Unfortunately I can remember this show. Jeff Ltd. was a terrible show with above all a terrible performance by the lead character that is what I remember most of all about this show. The plots all involved him trying to trick people into giving him money or trying to trick women into sleeping with him or usually both of those things, all he did was con people and it always backfired because he was very bad at it and thought he was a lot smarter than everyone else when he wasn't. The ideas were only half baked and none of the jokes were funny because the performances were so bad and it was just badly written, you could see exactly where everything was going. I am glad this bad show was booted off the airwaves."
43571_0,"I have a very good remembrance from the original series. I don't know if those remembers will be destroyed if I'd watch again an episode. But I had preferred the idea of David Soul than this horrible picture. Stiller and Wilson are two of the worst actors I ever watched in a picture. Maybe the first could be an acceptable Starsky, but the second made a very stupid Hutch. At last, this is a very good example about how to destroy a good idea. To tell you the truth, I think the film has many good points. Seventies background, for example, is good: cars, clothes, caracterization of support actors... But the big problem is Stiller and Wilson."
43616_0,"As I tuned in for the new 5th season, I was amazed. Not in how good the show was (not that it's ever been Emmy material) But how the creators/producers thought that people were so stupid. Clearly, it's scripted and set up. I was flipping through the channels and it came on one day and I looked and what seemed to be a giant snake on one of the campers bed. That snake CLEARLY came from the amazon. It was as long as the bed, it was huge. The other head camper man (I think his name is Hunter) tries to get it and he's so ""freaked out"" he can't. Oh! No. Here comes Paris, she single handedly put the what looked to be like a python into a big gray bucket and carry it away. I mean, Come on.<br /><br />Another thing is the premier episode (which is the only one I watched all the way through.), Paris is talking with her mom and her mom say's ""Oh it's Nicole's birthday, why don't you call her?"" and then the camera switches to Nicole who see's her phone ringing and is like ""It's Paris."" And they make up on national TV. How cute and convenient that they both had cameras ready. Yeah OK. Plus I think the whole fight was a publicity stunt that got out of hand and they carried on. Then they made up just in time for the last season.<br /><br />The first season was good and so was the second. The third started gettnig worse and the fourth wasn't that good at all and now the last of the ""Simple Life"" series can have it's last season be as scripted as a CW drama. A reality show? Not even close. Entertaining? Hmmm... Not really. Believable? Please. In the last words, there are much better things on TV to watch on a Sunday. I highly DON'T recommend this TV show."
43661_0,"Cindy Collins Smith's review (see above) explains the context of this film very well. I strongly recommend reading it before you read any of the other reviews (including my own - below).<br /><br />'Epically awful' 'full of misinformation' 'a propaganda film which was so ineptly made that it had the opposite of its intended effect.' Much has been written about Reefer Madness and its importance in the history of film-making, so I won't bother to reiterate any of these opinions. Instead, I would like to look at Reefer Madness as a film. <br /><br />How does it rate as a film? <br /><br />Poorly. <br /><br />It has a predictable, uninteresting plot, cardboard cut-out characters, racial stereotypes presented as obvious facts, a stiff script, an unrelentingly plodding pace, and it is very poorly shot. The dramatic points in the plot are so badly acted, scripted and filmed that the film fails to produce any real drama, and the only likable characters in the film are, sadly, the ultimate villains. The editing isn't too bad.<br /><br />IMO, the fact that it was shot with very little budget over a very brief period and was not intended to be taken very seriously does not really help matters much. The low budget shows. Some competent acting talent was squandered. And the film really isn't funny unless you're high! <br /><br />The plot is simple - a clean cut American Boy is given a joint in place of a cigarette and is, from that point forward, spun out of control down the path to lunacy, addiction, and violence. Saying any more would lead to a spoiler, and, just in case any of you are seriously considering watching this film, I wouldn't want to ruin what little entertainment value there is in it. Having stopped experimenting with drugs twenty years ago, I can not imagine anybody even being amused by this film unless they themselves were on drugs. It's simply poor. And poor does not necessarily = funny.<br /><br />Unless a film is particularly artful, I will rate it according to its entertainment value, not necessarily its technique, theory or method. This, for me, is one of those films which does more harm than good - it is neither an effective propaganda piece nor a parody of one, and therefore deserves a single star."
43706_0,"Watching this disaster, I think I must've said ""I can't believe that I'm still watching this"" about fifty times. I'm supposed to believe that the guy from Mannequin is tough? HAH! And Robert Patrick, shame on you! In this film, Evil T-100 you ain't.<br /><br />I would've rated this movie a ""1,"" but it was comically bad. Too bad MST3K isn't in production anymore - this one's prime material."
43751_0,"Couldn't really tell what this was about for most of the movie. Was it a B horror flick or a closeted young girl's sexual awakening?<br /><br />I guess it tried to be a bit of both.<br /><br />Firstly, the acting all around was pretty awful, maybe with the exception of the mother. For someone who's never seen the outside world or (presumably) been to school, Rauchine was pretty well spoken. This comes down to either bad casting or bad acting. And the young British actor playing the male lead, well I have a theory that producers think Americans can't detect really bad acting if the actor has an English accent. Too bad it sticks out like a sore thumb to the rest of the world. The scrawny weakling trying to play tough was pretty funny, and then the cry-baby ""please I don't deserve thiiiss"" sequences had me in stitches. And it was pretty obvious to everyone that this ""harmless"" and ""nice"" Englishman was only out to get into the young girls pants from the start.<br /><br />Now we come to the plot. I give the film some credit in that it managed to explain things somewhat towards the end, but it was pretty confusing leading up to that. The grandmother was supposed to be a ghost, and since the mother was the only one who could see her that seemed semi-obvious, except that she was opening doors, closets and chests and constantly grabbing the mother. Ghosts can't, er, do that stuff. And one scene which was hilarious was the young man trying to explain how he's a counseller to stop people doing things that are bad for them, and what addiction was, all while ostentatiously smoking a cigarette. He didn't smoke one in the entire rest of the film.<br /><br />Pure class.<br /><br />We got some nice gore at the end but it wasn't really very thrilling or satisfying after the boring, mostly pointless lead in. And putting a graphic throat slashing during a sex scene is a pretty good way to gross people out. Also of note were the sweeping helicopter shots of the forest stuck in randomly at the end, making us think there was some kind of ghost or presence after them. There wasn't, so they made no sense and seem to have been put in there as an afterthought in the hopes they'd make the film look more ""artsy"".<br /><br />Nice try.<br /><br />Cheap, tacky and pointless movie - but I suppose they have their place. It seems this killed Margaret Langrick's career as it was the last film she made.<br /><br />4/10"
43797_0,"From writer/director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) I had a vague idea of what this film consisted of, and I was pretty close. Basically two nerdy teenage boys, Gary Wallace (The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are desperate to be liked, and of course sex-obsessed, and in their desperation (inspired by watching - a coloured version of - Frankenstein, 1931) they decide to create the perfect woman. They weren't counting on the computer gaining so much power it would actually make their woman a reality, but it happens, and Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) is determined to help them have a good time. Lisa, who can get absolutely anything she wants (e.g. expensive cars, mutant bikers to appear) has a purpose to turn them into men by putting them in a couple of situations to boost their confidence, and they are on the road to becoming accepted by others. Of course it is at the big party (they always wanted) they meet the girls they would have always wanted, and Lisa's job is done. Also starring Bill Paxton as Chet Donnelly, Suzanne Snyder as Deb, Judie Aronson as Hilly, young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian, Robert Rusler as Max, Commando's Vernon Wells as Lord General, Britt Leach as Al Wallace, Barbara Lang as Lucy Wallace, Ivor Barry as Henry Donnelly, Ann Coyle as Carmen Donnelly and the original Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Mutant Biker. LeBrock is obviously very attractive, and there are one or two amusing moments, but the comedy is pretty crass, but it was interesting to see younger Paxton and especially future star Downey, Jr. in a film of this sort. It was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Okay!"
43841_0,"How could one go wrong with a film about a masked cult in an Arizona desert town that worships someone called Bryan? The premise sounds pretty good, the execution, though, leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />This is mostly video-taped ""archive footage"" from a man who was investigating this cult. There's a bit of creepiness to the proceedings but mostly it's just plain dull. A classroom full of kids with Bryan masks is probably the most effective scene in the movie, but after that, well, there's nothing to hold one's interest. Even the presence of a few ""cult film"" types, like Tony Todd, George Wendt, Brinke Stevens, and even Lloyd Kaufman, can't save this, because their roles are pretty nondescript and brief. I can't really stress how disappointing this whole thing is, and it sounded so interesting. It's not.<br /><br />Anchor Bay used to be one of my favorite movie companies, and now its reduced to putting stuff out like this....pretty sad. Were they not making any money with the classic horror films that they used to put out? Very sad.<br /><br />Anyway, ""Bryan Loves You"" is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination, and the box art even states that it's ""eerily reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange"". Like hell it is. Avoid, avoid, avoid. 2 out of 10."

Instead of trying to discover the cause, all the dinosaurs stand about arguing and watch as their beloved valley gradually dries up and eventually catches fire. No wonder this lot died out. Eventually another quest plot kicks in and an avalanche of parental advice and anti-bullying sentiment ensues, the soppy moralising about sharing and working together more than living up to the film's nauseating title. It's all very well intentioned, I guess, but the cutesy-poo tone and irritating characters ensure there's nothing to engage any adults nagged into watching it."
43931_0,"During preparations for Thanksgiving a few years back, my dad noticed that no one had made any candied yams. Fine, we bought a can, warmed them up and set them out. Nobody touched them, pa included. ""Why,"" we asked, ""did you insist on the yams?"" Simple--tradition. With Thanksgiving you need candied yams.<br /><br />And with New Years in central Europe, you need ""Dinner for One."" That people here love it, is clear. *Why* they love it is an absolute mystery. I honestly believe that it is enjoyed primarily because it is tradition -- it is beloved, so people love it. Being married to a German, I have now seen this short at least five times; I *have* laughed during it. Of course, I can pretend to like yams, too.<br /><br />The film relies entirely on the clownish antics of the protagonist, Freddie Frinton, as he steadily drinks himself into oblivion. Purely pie-in-the-mush humor here, with gags that were old when the film was made forty years ago. Neither is Frinton a genius of physical comedy, his timing truly hit-and-miss in the skit.<br /><br />If you are from central Europe, you have already seen this film. Otherwise, spare yourself the bother."

What parasite? what happened in the freezer?? This takes ages to get started and by then interest ebbs away to the point where you just end up staring at the screen blankly. I thought Luke Goss was absolutely brilliant in the TV version of Frankenstein but sadly he seemed to lack any gusto in this bag of dead goats, who-ever wrote this seriously needs to choose a different career path as screenplays are Definitely not their forte. In short this film is an absolute must for either insomniacs or amateur brain-washers.It's dreadful!!"
44066_0,"Hollywood is known for its summertime action ""flicks"", and recent action films such as The Matrix began to show a hopeful turn towards a trend of thoughtful plots and interesting stories. Unfortunately, the large success of Resident Evil: Apocalypse may very well be the deathblow to this promising new trend. In a sense, the title speaks for itself; Resident Evil: Apocalypse may very well be the apocalypse of intelligent action movies.<br /><br />After a new virus breaks out in a large industrialized city, citizens begin mutating into cannibalistic, flesh-eating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation, consisting of the people most directly responsible for the outbreak, takes measures to quarantine the city, turning it into a horrific sanitarium. The story follows several characters as they attempt to survive and escape the city with the help of an unseen ally who keeps contact with them from outside the city. Things further complicate when ""Nemesis"", the movie's biggest, toughest monster, arrives for the sole purpose of killing just about everything he perceives as a threat.<br /><br />The plot of Resident Evil: Apocalypse is, perhaps, the single worst piece of writing recently played out before the eyes of unfortunate movie fans. From the very beginning, the story begs questions that are never answered: who gave the Umbrella Corporation a building permit for a gigantic wall that would circle the city and with which they could, at a moment's notice, lock everyone inside? Why does Alice come crashing into a church through a stained-glass window, on a motorcycle, ""armed to the teeth"" with weaponry, to rescue the protagonists with perfect timing, despite the fact that she has never met them before and was, in the previous scene, walking around in the street with only a shotgun and no motorcycle at all? These and many more mind-boggling questions are completely ignored; the person who was in charge of this film's continuity should never work in Hollywood again. In fact, Resident Evil: Apocalypse has more plot holes than moldy Swiss cheese. However, even when ignoring the numerous plot holes -- which is almost an impossibility -- the story itself is still laughable, revolving partly around an insipid ""fight for survival"" that seems to rely on the main group splitting up and one of the subgroups being brutally slaughtered for no good reason, with the other part being about Alice (a character invented by the script-writer, as she was never in the game it is very loosely-taken from) and her relationship with the monster ""Nemesis"". Surprisingly, the director managed to craft a story that is significantly less interesting the one presented in the video game version. To cap off all the ""excitement"", the movie reaches its climax a full fifteen minutes before the end of the film! After a handful of survivors have escaped, Alice is caught and put in a lab, where she not only manages to escape, but also to manifest psychic powers while quipping off several lines that were used to advertise the movie in commercials. What was the purpose of this 15-minute epilogue? To set up the next movie in the series - a completely unnecessary task, as the film has already made it clear that there is absolutely no help for the next sequel in terms of quality. In a way, it could be said that the one thing the plot truly accomplished was setting the stage for even more cinematic fodder in the future.<br /><br />The acting was not bad, and, in general, was as good as it could have been, given the material the actors had to work with. Although Alice is mildly interesting (do largely to her reflections) and well played by Milla Jovovich, the rest of the characters were mostly stale archetypes. The most blatant example is the character of L.J., played by actor Mike Epps, who embodies every ""black"" stereotype that is popular today. This character's only true purpose is comic relief, and to that respect, he does it dryly.<br /><br />The cinematography offers a wide variety of different camera shots, as well as providing a constant supply of ""eye candy"". In what is easily the highlight of the film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse shows some impressive-looking stunts, such as a scene of Alice running down the side of a sky scraper with either the intent to kill, or the intent to break her legs. Either way, the scene was a joy ride for the vision. Truthfully, the only badly shot scenes that come to mind are the blurry scene (unnecessary, ugly, and pointless), and the climatic fight scene at the end (badly cut and confusing). Overall, though, the cinematography was decently good, which is likely the cause for this film making so much money in the box office.<br /><br />The setting was exactly what you would expect for an apocalyptic zombie movie - a big city with lots of undead people. The sets maintained a Gothic look throughout, and few scenes took place in daylight. Thankfully, the lighting was very well done, so the film maintained a dark, night-time look while simultaneously allowing the viewers to perfectly see all that was happening. Sets based on real buildings, such as schools and police stations, all looked exactly as they should. Resident Evil: Apocalypse had a big budget, and that fact is made apparent by the great sets and props.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing saves the movie from its horrible plot. A plot should provide any movie with its base, and with a plot so holey and incoherent, everything that could have made Resident Evil: Apocalypse good simply falls apart. Despite the big budget, some reasonably well-known actors, and a license and subject-matter with a cult following, nothing can gloss over the essential flaws that keep this movie from any kind of greatness. People who prefer to see mindless exaggerated action sequences, devoid of any decent plot, will likely enjoy Resident Evil: Apocalypse. However, those interested in intelligent, well-written stories will do well to look elsewhere."
44110_0,"This miniseries was mostly a 7.5 or so for me, until the last half of the final part where they proceeded to:<br /><br />- Basically ignore (they threw in a casual explanation) the two survivors of Piedmont sub-plot <br /><br />- Ignore the sub-plot (even if it was a horribly clichéd one) of the estranged wife of Dr Stone, and rebellious son <br /><br />- Ignore the fact that there were airborne rubber eating Andromedas above Piedmont when the helicopters flew over <br /><br />- Turn the Andromeda strain into a visible on-screen entity <br /><br />- Provide no clear reason for why Dae Kims character died upon throwing a thumb <br /><br />- Flub the ending of the reporter sub-plot, so it became a total ""Who Cares?"" <br /><br />- Give Andromeda an actual (and completely dumb) origin, rather than leave it mysterious like the novel <br /><br />- Bore us all to death with environmentalist clichéd 1960s Star Trek-esquire moralising <br /><br />- Bore us past death to ""government conspiracy"" plot line that's so horribly overdone <br /><br />- Provide no reason as to why there was lots of rubble falling down the central shaft<br /><br />But perhaps the most burning of the flaws with this miniseries was the action that occurred when the nuclear fail-safe was activated. Besides being motivated by a plot contrivance rather than logically occurring as it did in the novel, it was also horribly dragged out.<br /><br />I recorded this and watched it back via Sky+ (Tivo-esque machine for those of you not in the UK) and I must have fast forwarded through most of that climbing and crawling sequence. It actually seemed to me like because they had a few ex-24 stars, they felt like the thing needed to happen in real time. <br /><br />Do film-makers really think we need to see every excruciating detail of climbing up ladders, climbing down ladders, throwing thumbs, climbing into vents, climbing out of vents, crawling across a floor, crawling up a wall, struggling to remove a key-card, struggling to remove a thumb.<br /><br />Just get to the point, we don't want to see 10 minutes of padding in a 15 minute ""action"" sequence!"

The relationship between Danielle and boyfriend Justin bares no chemistry whatsoever and the sex scene just seemed like any other sex scene in a movie. In a nutshell the movie wasn't that great, and it was disappointing to see Cerina Vincent try to out act the bad storyline, after a first class performance in Cabin Fever."
44200_0,It seems that over the last few years feminism is getting a stronger hold on anime. This is more than evident in this picturesque and extremely depressing anime - among the same level of depressing as Neon Genesis and Elfen Lied. What I could see almost instantly that the sinister and well hidden agenda of this anime is undermine the male gender while lionising and glorifying the female. This anime is not the usual man-hating that anime like Love Hina and almost every other recent anime which is slapstick has. This is far more serious. The anime asks me were women oppressed in the preceding generation? The answer of course is yes - there were some tyrannical men who wanted to 'oppress women.' But in the World Wars hundreds of men were killed just to investigate enemy grounds - they were expendable. This anime is a prime example of a source that will be used in the approaching inevitable Men's Movement as it depicts men as evil thoughtless zombies who answer to their dodgy generals and political leaders who are killed by the two heartless female assassins as if they were nothing! An example that men are oppressed by other men yes but thats not the worst of it! Mirielle and especially Kirika unlike the men they slay so casually and cruelly - and it almost always IS men - bleed - as if trying to show they are human and the men they kill are not. The cast is all female with Chloe joining in too add to the killing. This anime lionises women with the two maidens of death hogwash that will make any male viewer who is not a complete wuss wonder about his worth as a man - its just like Lucy from Elfen Lied being made to look like a holy virgin pure daughter of the mother god! Can you imagine the success of this anime if it were two men who were killing women every episode? It would be banned from countries! It does have an interesting story I'll admit though the ending is just plain pathetic as is Kirika who is supposed to be some rip off of Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis who's lost her memory. I can't give an anime that depressed the hell out of me a good rating. It seems that the only serious anime now a days are plagued by feminism. If its not slapstick anime where its easy to have the females kicking around the 'perverted' weak males then they'll just do anything to make females the leads and in charge and by far the stronger and more pure and innocent sex in the more powerful anime. This anime is a good watch for anyone really though. As it will further educate the male population how worthless their lives are and how hated they are and thus speed up the arrival and strengthen the backlash against the very message of this anime - feminism. People just love this anime because they are so blind to this fact.
44246_0,"I am a huge fan of Stallone.. but this movie was ridiculously bad.. seriously.<br /><br />Like I said.. never question my allegiance to the Sly movies.. but this movie was terrible. Bad acting all around (accept for James Woods at parts) bad plot. bad writing. bad screen play. bad character development. bad SEX SCENE (INCREDIBLY long, drawn out and totally unnecessary!)<br /><br />I'm not gonna rip on stuff like how completely unlikely it is that someone (especially in 1994) would have as complex of devices as they had in this movie because lets face it, this isn't Stallone's first unrealistic movie nor is it probably his MOST unrealistic movie.<br /><br />I did get a laugh at the hotel/bomb/water scene though... no spoiler there :)<br /><br />Anyway, that's my opinion, take it or leave it.<br /><br />Fox-x"
44291_0,"Every big con movie since the ""Sting"" is a convoluted set of plots in which there are a bunch of good guys among the bad guys, and visa versa. There is a twist or two or three at the end, but they are so expected, they are hardly shockers. In fact, they are getting to where they are basically the ""Sting"" in new clothes. This movie is no exception. It uses the blueprint of con movie elements with little new ground. This is a ""seen one ya seen 'em all"" con game story, IMO. The newer ones just add a few more unimaginative side stories, involve modern devices such as electronic banking, computer technology, a little more of the sex angle,etc. However, complicating a tired plot doesn't make it better."
44336_0,Kindly Dr. John Garth (Boris Karloff) is found guilty of a mercy killing and sentenced to hang. While in prison he experiments in trying to find a serum that halts old age. He uses the blood of an executed murderer and tries it on himself. He is then pardoned and finds the serum works...but it turns him into a cold-blooded killer which he has no control over.<br /><br />This is pretty much a forgotten movie and it's easy to see why. It's pretty slow and dull with terrible dialogue and questionable science. Also it's (technically) not a horror movie--it plays more like a melodrama with horrific touches. Wonderful actress Evelyn Keyes is in here too but is given nothing to do. Karloff single-handedly saves this from total disaster. He's just great in his role--he makes the worst dialogue sound like Shakespeare! Also when the killing urge takes over you can actually see the changes in his face and mannerisms and there are also some nice atmospheric scenes at the end. There's a funny lapse in continuity--Keyes finds out by the morning paper about a murderer--but a scene outside the house shows it's night time! This is really only for Karloff fans. I give it a 4.
44381_0,"Its not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it comes real close to it...the stunts are OK, but you just keep wondering why the hell is nobody shooting their gun at the freakin'""class 4"" when he's right in front of them, being surrounded by 5 people!! Second of all, the acting, it's just plain afwul. No emotions, and when there are, they are misplaced.<br /><br />I guess if you like English movies with no depth, bad effects, bad acting but a lot of fighting and shooting then you could watch this, otherwise just leave it...<br /><br />p.s. i guess the ones voting this movie 10 have probably been used as props!"
44426_0,"Once in a while, you watch a movie where you can just immediately tell that the directors mother is also his aunt. One such movie is Ghost Lake. As a no-/low-budget filmmaker, I generally sympathize with others in this end of the field. One has to cope with annoying editors and actors who, in various strange ways, convince you that they can actually act and sign on to the point where it's too late to replace them. But much of this can be forgiven if the general intention with the movie is good or just honest. Not so the case with Ghost Lake. It repeatedly rips off one horror movie after the other, all the while setting new lows in acting, shooting and musicianship (yup, the score was awful to boot).<br /><br />That being said, I did laugh my ass off watching it. Watching this movie was the equivalent of reading a list of cinematic don't's. And I don't mean ""don't"" as in ""Don't use voiceovers"" and similar snooty filmschool bs. I mean ""don't"" as in, ""Don't do this, because it looks like you can't tell your ass from your elbow, anyway you slice it"". If you're in any way into films (just being an avid moviegeek will do) this movie will provide literally dozens of laughs-per-minute with it's machine-gun like barrage of ineptitude. You're going to want to show this to your friends just to see their bewildered expression that simply says ""Wtf were they thinking?!"" like nothing else.<br /><br />If your idea of awesome cinematic experiences is films like Death Tunnel or Kaw, well this movie is too shoddy for even that. No person living could possibly like this dreck, and the mere possibility is downright offensive."
44471_0,The only appeal of this film is to see the Stooges in their earliest film appearance--and to get a glimpse of the now-reviled Ted Healey. I can see why the Boys parted ways with Healey. His treatment of them comes off as brutal and mean-spirited (even by Stooge standards!) A curiosity piece.
44516_0,"An evil force called Zatteen fertilizes many women from Earth with his seed before being eliminated, and their children inherit and perpetuate his power. Barbara Collins (Joanne Nail) is the last woman on Earth with this gift, and her daughter Katy Collins (Paige Connor) has an evil telekinetic power. A battle between good and evil forces settles on Earth. ""The Visitor"" has a very promising story and a great cast, with names such as John Huston, Glenn Ford, Shelley Winters, Sam Peckinpah and Lance Henriksen. I bought this unknown VHS expecting a great movie. However, the screenplay and the direction are horrible and completely confused, and it is impossible to understand many parts of the story. The characters are also horribly developed, and in the end, this movie is a complete mess. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Herdeiros da Morte"" (""Inheritors of the Death"")"
44561_0,"I just watched Superman III and was excited to see Richard Pryor on the cover, but then I even thought as I was paying for the rental ""wait, why am I excited to see Richard Pryor more than Christopher Reeve?"", it was an interesting thought. But I was thinking maybe it's just because I was just more used to being excited about some kind of comedy, but the problem was that it seemed like the comedy took over what could've been a great super hero story.<br /><br />Superman/Clark Kent is now invited to his high school reunion where he sees his old high school crush and they hit it off. Gus, played by Pryor, is a computer worker, he is asked by a big boss to play with the computers and control the weather and more! But when Superman interferes with that, they decide to throw some kryptonite at him, but it fails, but turns Superman into a bad guy! Hence the alternate title of ""Superman vs. Superman"".<br /><br />Like I said, it just didn't seem to balance right with these two huge movie stars. In the 70's and 80's, Richard Pryor could do no wrong, he was so popular, and I think that overshadowed Christopher's presence on the screen. The comedy and drama didn't mesch well, I just think that this could've been a great sequel, but just didn't excel to what it could'v been.<br /><br />4/10"
44606_0,"Mind you the ""rubber shark"" many reviewers mention isn't rubber at all...It's real! Only it's...obviously dead. A dead baby shark they must have bought at the local Korean fish market or something. Watching an extra, in a fake-looking ape suit, pretending to wrestle with a dead baby shark pretty much sums up the production values in this film. <br /><br />See it so you can't believe it! <br /><br />The movie's American ads actually stated ""not to be confused with King Kong"", but in some countries it was released as ""The return King Kong"". What also cracked me up was that the ape has apparently no vocal cords of any sort : he does not make a sound during the whole movie! The credits also thank the US military for their cooperation. How come all the tanks, etc, look like toys? Is this actually anti-American propaganda, aiming to pretend that the US have the crappiest army ever seen? Mind-numbing."

I will never get my 2 hours back. In fact I'll stop typing this right now, because that movie is still occupying my time, and not another second...

44697_0,"From the director of Chinese Ghost Story and Naked Weapon (and collaborator in the action scenes from Hero and House of the Flying Daggers), we have a story about an ex-CIA agent who's daughter is kidnapped. Its not just any ex-CIA agent, but Steven Seagal. Yes !! Pony-tail is back, BACK WITH A VENGEANCE. (Sorry, I had to do that).<br /><br />This is your typical action movie, usually based on some revenge/honor theme, where the hero has to take out dozens to hundreds of henchman and usually a ""Boss"" character, or several. The acting is atrocious and all we are left with is the action (and a lot of wire-work). Steven brought his typical dead-pan/Prozac acting along. This movie is not going to be on anybody's Christmas list, however, it is hysterical and very very light. I was laughing the whole way through the movie.<br /><br />Steven Seagal is looking to do some major butt-kicking. Unfortunately, most of the serious butt-kicking is done by a much younger, thinner man (the stunt guy is actually wearing fake fat to look like Steven), who has a lot more physical talent than Steven had in his prime. This is further compounded by the fact that the stunt man performs stunts that Steven could never perform (jump kicks, jump spin kick, and all other stunts involving jumping high).<br /><br />The movie seems to have been filmed entirely in Bangkok, Thailand and recruited what seems to be the entire cast of Onk Bak, minus Tony Jaa. The wheelchair boss and Don the drug dealer stand out in my mind.<br /><br />There are somethings about the movie that bother me. Steven (who is the star of the movie) looks like he just woke up in Bangkok after weeks of binging on milkshakes and vodka, with no money and no change of clothes. He looks dirty and grimy. I wouldn't sit next to him on the subway if he looked like that. Next, what was up with the Steven's gun? He seemed to have a magic weapon. This weapon fires anywhere from 30-50 bullets and rarely needs another clip. Also Steven has become such a big star, he no longer needs to aim his weapon. He just fires in the general direction of his target. Steven's sex scene was certainly interesting. It made me quite nauseous. Shoving toothpicks under my fingernails is pleasurable as compared to watching Steven has sex. The cinematography was quite strange. I didn't realize the same guy who did certain Outer Limit and Star Trek episodes was still alive (tilt the camera 45 degrees). The wire action becomes ridiculous, especially when you are trying to make a somewhat realistic action movie (imagine what one would think if Tony Jaa jumped 10 feet straight in the air and did 2 full revolutions). I also like the variation on Thai boxing : Thai Transvestite Claws and High Heels Boxing. Not only that, what was the deal with all the mystical crap introduced 10 minutes before the end of the movie, complete with with a Thai Mako impersonator who had taken too much PCP ??<br /><br />One may think from my review that I hated this movie. This is not true. This is the funniest movie I've seen since Shaun of the Dead, unfortunately that movie was trying to be funny. I do recommend this movie as a rental,a discount-bin purchase, or a late night cable session while completely wasted.<br /><br />-Celluloid Rehab"
44741_0,"If there's anything on TV that could make ""Cop Rock"" look like ""Masterpiece Theatre"", San Francisco International is it. Pernell Roberts, long before he discovered his TV niche as Trapper John, stars here as an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, pompous head of security for the San Francisco airport. ><br /><br />In order for you to get an idea of his modus operandi as head of security, he stages a crisis aboard an airplane full of congressmen in order to demonstrate his need for more security. Thankfully, the scene of these VIPs cleaning up after discovering the hoax was left on the editing room floor. > David Hartman also stars as a clueless pilot whose wife is kidnapped. The kidnapping takes place so that Hartman's character can stall his next flight long enough so that the bad guys can steal some gold, money, potatoes...who really cares?<br /><br />This movie throws in every bad TV movie element of the time, missing only the opportunity to cast either Bert Convy or one of the Landers sisters. Roberts' character is neither likable nor identifiable in this film.<br /><br />Sterno says keep this film on your personal radar, only to make sure that you've shot it down and to watch it go down in flames."

That is to either throw up or shoot yourself if you can't escape.<br /><br />The mummy was pathetic, there was little horror, and the ending was a mess.<br /><br />Stay away - far away."
44877_0,"I'm hardly going to be the one to excoriate the makers of 1980s sex-fueled quasi-comedies for their work. Sure,these films were about as easily forgotten as the heaps of bad slasher flick sequels and wanna-bes that ALSO populated the cinemas over(mostly)the summers of that era. I mean,to be sure,I probably watched quite a few of these films,albeit on cable or on video,and I know I got exactly what I wanted out of them:cheap laughs and some eyefuls of fine looking,supple young female bodies.<br /><br />But I suppose my biggest gripe with this particular film is that it seemed like the makers of this film really weren't concerned AT ALL with anything BUT the sex scenes,wet T-shirt contests and the beach shots of anonymous hot bodies. The actual comedy that it purportedly tries to convey is so much an afterthought that the gags and punchlines seem forced and embarrassing to the actors involved in them.<br /><br />The story here(As if it needs much explaining)is where a young stepson(David Knell) of a local politician(Dobald Symington),who,along with another clean-cut rich buddy friend(Perry Land)go out,beyond the wishes of the politician step-dad,and head for Fort Lauderdale,Florida. Once there they share a hotel space with two near-Neanderthal college dudes(PAul Land and Steve Bassett,a little TOO convincing at it)who decide to show their outsider roomies a good time. NAturally,the two clean lads will find love instead of instant sex(though they'll find THAT too;remember,this IS the '80s)in the arms of hot-yet-sympathetic lasses played by Corinne Wahl and JAyne Modean. Veterna actor Richard Schull is there as a private detective dispatched by the politico to track his stepson,but is truly there as a punchable,doofy comic foil.<br /><br />Director Sean S. Cunningham,probably more famous for directing the first and ninth in the Friday the 13th series(among other films),helms this pic and looks pretty unfamiliar with comedy in this effort. I came away more obsessed with the hot bods,like Wahl,Modean,one day up-and-coming starlet Nikki(then Bobbi)Fritz and Rhonda Flynn,than I was with most of the people in this flick. Worth a look for the light,sun-kissed sex content and not much more,which,when you consider the movie poster,the title and the plot summary is probably all that it intends to be."
44921_0,"Although this is typical of the low-budget quickies that Warners churned out like hotcakes in the Thirties it offers Bette Davis in her most youthfully appealing ""down-to-earth platinum blonde girl"" phase. You can find the same character in THREE ON A MATCH, THE GIRL FROM 10TH AVENUE, THE PETRIFIED FOREST and others. She exudes an innocent but intelligent, unaffected femininity that seems to have evaporated by the time she hit her stride with JEZEBEL, so it's good that this phase of her career is preserved - if only to track her evolution as an actress. Note the energy and vitality she injects (perhaps effortlessly) into a supporting role as the girlfriend-wife, stealing every scene she's in - without relying on conventional beauty. It's kind of fun also to see how the scenarists managed to leap from one implausible, contrived plot development to the next - but that's a secondary matter because most of these films were beyond belief. The point was to make a moral point, not to be narratively convincing. The point here being: evil gangsters, beware of the authorities because they'll get you!"

45010_0,"I am Chinese myself and this film is just embarrassing. A film that relies so heavily on special effects, and yet the effects look like something that was made in the early 90's. One scene that stood out was the scene where the girl is flying as a kite for no apparent reason but to show how beautiful the film is, and sadly they failed at that attempt. It showed how terrible and flawed the effects are. Tell me you didn't laugh when the guy is speed crawling/running through the 10000 bulls. The sets look like sets literally. There's no authenticity and what, when, and where is this story supposed to be taken place? A fairytale land? It looks half cartoon and half live action most of the time. The acting was laughable.<br /><br />Performance done by Nicholas Tse was unintentionally funny. Do we really need an evil villain that speaks like a gay man and yet is pseudo-straight that wants to have sex with a woman? He acted like he was in another movie, and perhaps it might be better if he just go on and make a movie of his own. Cecilia Cheung, all I remember from the film is her infamous line- ""Do you want to see what's underneath?"" One dimensional character that is supposed to gain our sympathy and yet she failed to engage the audience to sympathize with her. I am not going to go into the other characters, the guys in the black feather cape is terrible as well.<br /><br />This film is basically scenes slapped together hoping to pass as art, but most of the ""artistic"" scenes turned out to be hilariously funny.

I've never seen her look anything less than fabulous, but her waist looks particularly long and slender in this movie. Unfortunately, the most skin she shows is her face and arms. Her most sensual and erotic scene is when one of the Evil Alien Conquerors feels up her hairy ""unibrow""."
45146_0,"Ostensibly, it should be hard to understand why certain movies slip into obscurity despite being loaded with talent, but then you come across a case like this one and the possibility suddenly becomes not just plausible but inevitable. On paper, this Anglo-Canadian ""existentialist"" thriller certainly had potential: an impressive cast  Donald Sutherland, David Hemmings, John Hurt, David Warner, Christopher Plummer and Virginia McKenna  was mouthing the words of screenwriter Paul Mayersberg under the guidance of director Stuart Cooper (the man behind recent Criterion DVD release, OVERLORD [1975]) and being lit by the late great cinematographer (and frequent Stanley Kubrick collaborator) John Alcott; besides, the whole thing was being overseen by producer Hemmings himself. So, where did the film go wrong? <br /><br />Well, for starters, the central mystery itself is not very interesting: the neglected wife of brooding Donald Sutherland  the No. 1 hit-man for an enigmatic espionage organization  is forever threatening to leave him and does exactly that at the very start of the film; unfortunately, while Sutherland is very good in his role and literally the best thing in it, the actress playing his wife (Francine Racette) is as stiff and unappealing as one of her husband's handiwork. This fact renders the knowledge that Racette is none other than Sutherland's own wife in real life as well almost impossible to believe, since this is hardly borne by their interaction here  least of all during a fragmentary sex scene that ludicrously apes Nicolas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW (1973) which, of course, also starred Sutherland! Actually, I had seen Racette act previously in two notable films  Dario Argento's FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET (1971) and Joseph Losey's MR. KLEIN (1976)  but I can't really say if her efforts were any better there. For the record, THE DISAPPEARANCE proved to be Racette's penultimate film before retiring to raise her three children with Sutherland. Thankfully, although most of them are practically extended cameos, the supporting cast  of whom, I thought, John Hurt comes off best  does keep one watchingbut, again, the utterly predictable double surprise ending closes the film with a whimper instead of a bang.<br /><br />Equally to blame for the film's ultimate failure is Stuart Cooper whose direction is pretentious to a fault and, unsurprisingly, he too faded exclusively into TV-movie limbo soon after; for what it's worth, many years ago I did get to watch two of his TV ventures  A.D. (1985) and THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM (1988)  both of which were large-scale productions. Having said that, screenwriter Mayersberg is himself well-known for his non-linear scripts but the would-be audacious time-jumping techniques abused here merely attempt to imbue an obscure and thin plot with some elusive sense of significance; incidentally, even if the 88-minute version I watched was 12 minutes short of the original, I doubt that the missing footage would made things any clearer! Unfortunately for the viewer, Stuart Cooper is no visual stylist like Nicolas Roeg, much less a master film-maker in the league of Alain Resnais! Besides, given the structure and themes of the film, at times I couldn't help but unfavorably compare it to John Boorman's vastly superior POINT BLANK (1967)..."
45191_0,"Fabian looks an awful lot like Michael J Fox. <br /><br />The film was good and it made you realize how much times have changed. Attitudes about marijuana are not nearly as close minded as they were back then. A teacher admits to smoking pot once in his life and he gets called a ""dope fiend"" by the chief of police. The principal and the coach won't even talk to this man in the hallway anymore because he admitted this. They hold secret meetings about spying on students to catch the dope dealers. Nowadays, schools could care less if a kid or a teacher has smoked pot. Just as long as it isn't interfering with their work, it's ok.<br /><br />I thought Fabian's character was a little over the top. He had too many things going on. One minute he's an art critic who admits to smoking pot, the next he's driving full speed out to meet some people at a drug deal to save a temper-prone, ""sensitive"" kid's life. And then he really pushes his luck with the hot lady teacher on a blanket by the ocean by literally forcing her to go on a date with him where he makes his moves way too fast. Then when she bails him out of jail, he doesn't dwell on the fact that she spit out $5000 for him, a guy she doesn't even want to talk to..? In the meantime, his voice remains calm while he keeps this very intense look on his face. This guy is all over the place and it doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I did like the leader of the pot club, however. At first he seemed too much of a clean cut, white, dorky football star to be the drug dealer he was, but as the movie went on, it became more apparent why this ""disguise"" made sense. He really was a rebellious, pot smokin' jerk, he just didn't wear the costume. That would be too obvious and he was smarter than that.<br /><br />The outcast, teen angsty kid did a good job acting like an idiot. He even had that idiot look in his eye like he is not taking in anything you are saying. When he gets wasted, he really plays the part well!<br /><br />All in all, the movie is worth watching if you can find it. There are good twists and good characters in this film. Fabian's role has too much going on for me to find it realistic, but the other characters are pretty real. It's a teen drama. I wish there had been trippy pot scenes, but they just barely touch on that."
45236_0,"I went to see this film because I have admired Kathy Bates' acting for years. I must say that I am confused as to why she would accept a role so beneath her abilities. Given that, she could have brought life into her character.<br /><br />As for Sarah Jessica Parker. Well, her ability to portray emotions ranges from clutching her chest to clutching her stomach. And when is this 40+ year old woman going to stop squealing like a stuck pig.

45281_0,"I really cannot understand why films like ""Kill Bill"" which are based on so much blood and gore are so popular... ""Kill Bill"" in particular, is 90% ugly scenes and 10% anything else. What is exactly interesting or artful in watching a comatose girl being raped, and then seeing her bite the tongue out of her rapist's mouth?<br /><br />In order to be fair, I must accept that the direction of the film is good. But what difference does this make, when the film in itself is completely unwatchable? I don't object to bloody scenes being shown in a film, provided that they serve some purpose in the plot, and they do not constitute the film's purpose instead (as it happens here).<br /><br />In brief, I find Tarantino completely overrated; what's more, in this film he goes way too low even by his standards. If ""Kill Bill"" wasn't directed by him, and no stars appeared in it, it would be a typical B-movie. Needless to say, I won't even think about watching Vol. 2. Verdict: 3/10."

But unfortunately, there is a fine line between imitating a popular style and using it, stretching it out so far that it becomes tedious and predictable. In short, this sketch show falls among the latter. There are some strong and pleasing sketches but the rest are clichéd. The ""comedy"" evolves from the actors after a few sketches, however after a while even their performances become tedious and predictable. The only plus side to their performance is their dominance over the script that fails to evoke any comedy. We tend to overlook the writing and focus on them. If anything, their performances save the poor scripts and without them I wouldn't have glanced at this show. If you pull out the actors and focus on the script, it is mediocre and poor. However, thinking back, I may sound self-contradictory because there was one highlight. One that stood out for me, was when Nick Frost woke up from a one night stand, trudges silently downstairs and comes across a picture of him and the lady he slept with, married, including another with a child. Eventually, he realises, it is another liaison with his wife. That, i found funny. But the rest slightly poor. However, i did have some expectations for the second series yet unfortunately, the second series failed to meet these expectations. It is rather inconceivable to know that the show's producer & writer is none other than Ash Atalla, the producer of The Office. Nick Frost & Amanda Abbington are great actors, and frankly they are the only great thing in this show."
45371_0,"Question 1: *What* was this movie all about? Question 2: What or who prompted its selection as IMDb movie of the day?? (Which in turn has prompted this review.) This has got to be one of the most pretentious and pseudo-high brow movies I've ever seen. Soderbergh has made a movie that so labors on being arty, that you end up witnessing a massive exercise in an aimless and fruitless(one follows the other, I guess)story(?) telling.<br /><br />When I began watching this movie, I was all excited about it - what with such a massive star cast and Soderbergh's reputation. At the end of the movie, I felt cheated of my time and effort that this movie demanded.<br /><br />You're better off watching a re-run of ""Traffic""."

He didn't seem to act well and seemed like he just got out of college into acting school.<br /><br />What would you do if you were dying? Would you even go to all that trouble...? At least the DVD has some deleted footage. Besides that, I would only rent the movie if you want some unrealistic drama with little action and poor acting.<br /><br />Even the DVD & Movie Guide book rates the movie 3 out of 5 stars. No wonder why everyone is selling this movie cheap...it is because it doesn't capture your attention in a way you would remember it and make your jaw drop."

45551_0,"A successful author, Colum(Allen Scotti) returns to his ancestral home in an Irish village with wife, son and daughter in tow hoping to rekindle possible memories of slain parents he never knew. What he does discover is that inside him lying dormant is an animal desiring to get out. Threatening his well being is an imposing, gruff villager, Macroth(Brian Monahan)who may very well have been behind the death of his parents. Colum's wife, Stella(Jennifer Courtney), wishes to go home, quite a city gal longing for her hot coffee from Starbucks, having a great deal of trouble adjusting to her new environs. What's worse is that she feels a rift coming between her and Colum whose behavior is questionable. Colum realizes that an Irish wolfhound scouring about his cottage's grounds is in fact the animal form of a beautiful, voluptuous woman, Siobahn(Julie Cialini)who wishes to make passionate sexual contact with him. After succumbing to Siobahn's seductive allure, Colum finds the beast within starting to emerge, while Stella yearns to leave without him if necessary. Meanwhile Macroth eyes Stella causing quite a bit of friction between all involved. What Colum and Stella soon find is that the village folk are not all they appear to be.<br /><br />Ambitious but lackluster fantasy regarding a village of people who can actually transform into animals. Like Macroth who changes into a wolfhound like Siobahn. Another changes into a crow. The plot resembles the story of Cat People ever so slightly, but I had a problem with how the fantasy element of transformation is handled..it deserves more exposition as does how Colum's parents died. I think a great deal of the film is little more than getting Julie Cialini as naked as possible. Certainly her delicious naked flesh doesn't hurt, as long as she kept her mouth shut, but I didn't think she had that many sparks with Allen Scotti, for whom is her sexual partner during a few scenes. I never thought their love-making provided the right amount of erotic heat which is surprising since chains get thrown into the mix and blue light(..often quite an effective tool for erotica)within night scenes never quite elicits fireworks. The fight scenes between Macroth and Colum never catch fire either and have clumsily inserted dogs growling in the attempts to sell the beasts themselves attacking. The morphing sequences from human to beast leave much to be desired. Special effects in this film just are too cheap to effectively convey what the director so desires and he often has to resort to the use of objects to cloud humans before and during their transformation to, I guess, save on what little budget he obviously had. There's an unnecessary sex scene between Colum and two lesbian women(..Julie K & Regina Russell)that should also be erotic but comes off surprisingly empty because the director fails to establish whether or not they're actually even on top of him! I'd suggest seeing this merely to see Cialini naked, slapping Colum as he's chained to the bed while on top of him having the ride of her life. She also has a rather effective strip scene, removing her gown inviting pleasure. Maybe the problem is the lead actor, Scotti, who fails to generate fire with his new lover or a sense of love with his wife. The character of Stella spends most of the screen time upset with her husband's decision to leave home, feeling distant from Colum, or warding off Macroth's advances."
45597_0,"I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday, intending to tune-in to something else. Out of curiosity, I accessed the comments here, and found myself watching it to the end. I really didn't do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where you're ""fascinated,"" and watch it for ""another couple of minutes,"" until you finally just watch to the end. And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano, and their earlier roles. But great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here - story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb. mark), and Ben Matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them. No real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.<br /><br />Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. Actually Perry nearly always did this, but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, pronounce it ""reasonable doubt,"" and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show.<br /><br />But that said, Holland Taylor's histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her, in the courtroom portion of this story, made the actions of Matlock/Mason more-closely resemble the slow, often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in real-life courtrooms.<br /><br />Every character in this presentation was either insipid, unsympathetic, obnoxious, boring, improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.<br /><br />The ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if ""3rd-"") roles, even in this venue. Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story/performances, and 3 additional for the fascination factor."
45641_0,"I really don't need a war movie to be full of explosions to like it, but there was nothing about this movie worth liking. I really couldn't find a story to follow. The characters weren't developed enough for me to feel sympathetic for when they get picked off at the end. The production value of this film was like watching a play on PBS. If the producers and director wanted to give us a feel of what hell they went through in the trench having every other scene with the actors eating isn't going to help. I mean how about making it a true hell hole? I know this is supposed to take place in Summer, but mud, rain, and seeing the actor's breath to show cold, would have really helped. The No Man's Land was so Pristine that I thought the Tele-Tubbies were going to come rolling around. They could have thrown in barbed-wire, mortar shell holes, and the like.<br /><br />Don't even bother borrowing them from the library. This thing is really disappointing."
45687_0,"Legend of the Wolf Chinese Action Donnie Yen<br /><br />The poor-quality of this film can be adequately summarized by the following statement made by a proponent of this movie on IMDb: <br /><br />""Donnie Yen puts in what seems to be a new type of choreographic brilliance. This involves some quite close in shots of the two opponents arms flailing as they block and parry. So blurred are the movements that only the sound effects give us clues as to the blocking and hitting. It works very well.""<br /><br />This is perhaps the most absurd movie-related comment I have ever seen, but it very succinctly explains the warped perspective of many who hold the opinion that films such as this (as well as Storm Riders, A Man Called Hero, and Ashes of Time ) offer high-quality action set pieces. The illogic goes something like this: A blurry set of camera frames that are impossible to follow qualifies as a great action scene. The problem with this perspective is that ANYONE  even the most inept movie-maker on the planet  can make such a scene fairly easily. The million dollar question now arises: How can one claim the greatness of action that requires virtually no effort whatsoever to create?<br /><br />Why, then, do I give this film a 4 out of 10 instead of a 1 or 2? Simple. There are pieces of action scenes that show promise. In those rare instances when I could follow what was actually happening, the choreography was good. Unfortunately, these bits of promise were interrupted by inept camera-work that is usually invoked when the movie-maker is too lazy to painstakingly map out fight scenes or brainstorm over fresh combinations of moves and maneuvers. In other words, it's a cheap, pathetic method of film-making that covers up the low quality nature of the action at hand. Therefore, Donnie Yen made it easy on himself by lowering the bar to such an extent that fighting sequences will only require a marginal amount of choreography. <br /><br />The camera-work in this film is simply one of the worst I have ever seen. While watching the opening action sequence, for instance, I literally felt like vomiting when exposed to back-and-forth rapid-fire framing that necessitates a warning on the front of the DVD that this film may induce epileptic seizures.<br /><br />Finally, the plot line was horrible and the cinematography sub par for a movie made in the late 90s.<br /><br />Not recommended."
45731_0,"Well, I have myself to blame. I should have read about the movie and should NOT have rented it. But I did. :-(<br /><br />I like Steven Seagal. He is usually in entertaining movies with very good fight scenes. Be advised ! This is no ordinary Seagal movie. The little fighting he does is in the end of the movie and it is so bad that you wonder if he has gained so much weight that he can't move anymore.<br /><br />Well. What more can you say: This is a REALLY bad movie. The copy I rented had DTS sound. For what ? So that the explosions can sound good ? The other parts of the movie has really bad sound.<br /><br />SPOILERS: And the clock. What about it ? Was it some kind of trigger or what ? Not to mention the car that explodes without the ground even turning black. And ... ... Well actually there were so many bad things in this movie I could go on and on and on ..."
45777_0,"John Wayne as Ganghis Khan, and lots of white people playing Asians and making no effort to look and sound Asian. The Duke was a great actor, but a 6'4"" white man with blue eyes doesn't make a convincing Asian. Give him a much shorter Mexican brother, Jamuga, played by Pedro Armendariz, and a barely 5 foot mother who was only 7 years older than the Duke, Hunlun, played by Agnes Moorehead, and you have The Conqueror, one of the grossest examples of miscasting in Hollywood history. The other big f-up is the semi Biblical English dialog. If you just have to see this movie, and it is worthwhile for laughs if nothing else, get the DVD and turn the captions on. Otherwise you won't have clue what anyone is saying.<br /><br />The basic plot is actually pretty good. The stunts and battle scenes are good too. If it had been cast correctly and if the Biblical dialog had been eliminated, it could have been a good movie.<br /><br />Although never intended to be a comedy, it comes across as one, largely due to the ridiculous dialog and costumes, especially head gear. Agnes Moorhead's costume is especially hilarious, wrapped up like a mummy in green with only here face visible and huge multicolor beads dangling from each side of her head. Susan Hayward, who plays Bortai, Temujin's love interest, looks like a modern prostitute, in a succession of low cut dresses and modern high heels. Also included is a Las Vegas dance revue of scantily clad white women who have these things on there heads that look like pink doggie-doo. During the opening credits and later during the first battle, John Wayne is seen charging into battle on horseback, waving his sword in the air, and screaming like a Commanche with an expression of shear insanity on his face that had me busting at the seams. William Conrad plays Kasar, Temujins immensely strong but retarded brother, and plays it HORRIBLY. John Hoyt plays the Shaman, dressed in a white and yellow Merlin costume, the character is the stereotypical Japanese from WWII movies.<br /><br />Much is made about the fact this movie was filmed in SW Utah, about 100 miles or so from the Nevada Test Site which lead to the cast and crew being radiated and dying from cancer. I my opinion, this is grossly exaggerated. The facts are a lot of people die from cancer, actors included, and cancer has many causes. Also many of the deaths occurred decades after this movie was made and most of the actors lived into old age. This movie was filmed in 1954, but John Wayne didn't die until 1979. Several of the players survived him including, John Hoyt, William Conrad, Peter Mammokos (who is still living 50 years later), Chuck Roberson (stuntman, no screen role in this film), and the Duke's son Pat Wayne, who still lives. Las Vegas is about 100 miles from the Nevada Test Site, it hasn't died off from cancer. Several small Nevada towns, Tonopah, Goldfield, Beatty, Indian Springs, and Pioche, are literally next door to the Nevada Test Site, and they haven't died off from cancer either.<br /><br />This is generally regarded as the Duke's worst movie. Although this is definitely a bad movie, at least it is entertaining. The Fighting Kentuckian, the Fighting Seebees, and The Green Berets are all much worse, they are unwatchable."
45821_0,"Poor battle between Vampires flick.<br /><br />Paycheck job for the names (Tony Todd, Jason Connery and C Thomas Howell) this is one of those movies you look at and wonder if anyone was taking it seriously or whether anyone was doing it for more than the money. Okay Tony Todd maybe took thing a bit too seriously (he's way too intense) and the cinematographer was very serious about America Olivo's breasts, but other then that this seems to be a joke...except its not, or if it is it never signals that it it is. I thought after the opening attack on the feuding couple that we'd have some laughs after that but it never gets funny, at least not intentionally so.<br /><br />Only worth seeing if you have to see every vampire movie ever made."

Two people are dead within the first 10 minutes of the movie, one, this Yuka character never has any significance ever again in the film. The sister keeps coming back for no reason and the Mariko(?) never showed any reaction to all the crazy things that were happening. Detective Sakurai despite being a famous actor did absolutely nothing! Who were the little girl and her mom? What was everything? What happened to all the people? Why is the big question I'm left with. Also, what's up with Sayaka appearing in the end just in time to do NOTHING??? Yet another pointless, I don't even know what to call it. Oh yeah, and the spider man thing is because the daughter for no good reason had spider hair."
45911_0,"I was in two minds about buying this. I mean, an 80's fantasy flick in the vein of Conan sounds interesting doesn't it? At least thats what I thought. So I decided to buy this, and now I sort of regret it.<br /><br />Let me summarise the story:<br /><br />A ""holy"" warrior, Kain (David Carradine) comes across this little village that is dominated by two tyrants. Each of these have their little following of people, and both of them are arch-enemies. Basically, they're both locked in a struggle for control of the village well which is (conveniently) situated right in between their encampments. Cue our Hold Warrior, who plays the sides off against each other, to collect the rewards for doing so, but he also has his eye on a captive sorceress (Maria Socas). I suppose you can guess where the story is going from here - he tries to free the sorceress while staying alive and then there's a whole army of traders to contend with, most of which are quite angry as they were massacred before.<br /><br />Its a very simple plot, but there's just something that doesn't hit it off. The action is slow, and in between the few and far between fights, there are some quite tedious and boring places. I don't have a problem with the acting as such - I've seen much worse (but also much better) but Carradine seems a bit wooden throughout. Violence is nearly non-existent. The only blood you see is on a sword blade, and I mean, the ONLY place. The swords must be made of plastic or wood or something, because when they fight, it looks like they're fighting with stick, whacking each other over the head with not a drop of blood in sight. Maria Socas (the sorceress) goes about topless the whole movie, as you've probably heard by now. And along with the 4 breasted erotic dancer (no, its not that good) its a veritable display of female nudity. If you're after the nudity, there's far better in just about every other movie, so there's no way you should buy this just on that.<br /><br />Its a way to spend a mindless hour or so, at 77 minutes (I think) its not that long, but you'd probably be better off randomly switching on the TV. There are worse films, but this is pretty bad."
45957_0,"Other than a few items glanced at in the newspaper, I had no idea the intricate details of this movie, and went in hoping for something different. Alas, the first hour was not much of anything at all. And I wonder if the movie would have done so well if not for the purse strings and names of 2 of its executive producers. That aside, the story revolves around a 16-year-old living in Harlem in the 1970s. She is pregnant, for the 2nd time, by her father. Her mother is one in a long line of selfish, self-absorbed ignorant people, and played, by the way perfectly, by Mo'Nique. The last scene with Mo'Nique makes sitting through this boring film worth it. And yes, it was boring. But what frustrated me the most is that when actors are mumbling, as more and more are doing in movies, there is too much background noise (music in this movie), so it's difficult to understand what the character is saying. This was a major problem for me with this film. I would have so loved to hear what Precious was saying, in her own way, but she mumbled, talked street while also mumbling, and a lot of it was just drowned out. Just the same, I was ready to turn the movie off, but decided to stick it out. After the 1st hour it began to move as something was actually happening, and get more interesting until the somewhat climax at the end in the social worker's office (played okay by Carey). Yes, people lived like this, and still do. Children are abused, and in so many ways. The system can only do so much. And there are people who try to cheat the system, as the mother kept trying to do. Not as much drama as hyped, and some of the acting seemed forced. Did I miss something?"

46046_0,"I'm always interested in seeing a horror/western and this unofficial sequel to ""Django"" directed by Sergio Garrone and starring Anthony Steffen promised to offer just that. But evidently my impression wasn't positive. It's promise of combining the two genres, was overblown. ""Django The Bastard"" tried to create a seemingly supernatural atmosphere while at the same time keeping as close to reality as possible. And it failed.<br /><br />Anthony Steffen stars as Django a loyal, honest soldier who is betrayed by his officers in the Confederate army and seemingly killed along with his whole detachment. Now he apparently has risen from the grave to exact his revenge. In the opening scene we see Django carrying a cross through town. He stops in front of a building, and pins it in the ground. The men inside suspiciously examine Django, while finally discovering that the cross bears the name of them. Further more, on it is written the day of his death, today. What follows is a traditional shootout that leads to the obvious conclusion, Django now triumphant proceeds to punish all those responsible for the death of his comrades and his in a similar fashion.<br /><br />This movie has often been compared to Clint Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"", claiming that it's more or less been the inspiration. Honestly the only similarity found in both these movies is that they are presented as quasi-supernatural westerns. On the threshold between supernatural and natural, both posses characters that could or could not be spirits of vengeance. Such story is not anything new though and tales of such content have long existed in the western mythology. But ""Django The Bastard"" suffers from the inability to exploit it's features. The plot is shaky at best, often contradicting itself. At one point we have the titular character displaying unexplainable supernatural abilities, such as appearing from nowhere, disappearing, and even becoming transparent. While at another sequence Django gets, beaten, practically tortured, forced to run and hide from bad guy's henchmen. These plot elements did a great job at leaving me confused, but did little in creating that mystical atmosphere which was the supposed goal of the entire film. Django didn't feel supernatural because he was being beaten and didn't feel real because at one moment he became transparent. On other points of interest, namely the acting. Anthony Steffen does have the intimidating look, but his performance was lackluster and quite frankly it was flat. Nothing different can be said about the supporting cast. There was not a single character that made an impression, in fact to be honest I forgot most of them shortly after I saw the movie.<br /><br />Cinematography was a mixed bag. There were some really nicely directed tracking shots and overall stable, camera work. But the shootouts were unimpressive. Gorrene could have at least tried to put some more work in creating memorable action scenes to compensate for the second-hand plot. Ultimately what we get is a series of boring, uncreative, unsynchronized shootouts. What's even worse is that the gunned-down people tend fall in a slow irritating manner, it's as if they are being careful not to get hurt. Hello ? They are a supposed to be dead. Finally, the last thing worth commenting, namely the score. It is as forgettable as everything else in ""Django The Bastard"" I was neither able to remember who composed or any specific tune.<br /><br />""Django The Bastard"" might have a cool sounding name, but it doesn't have much else to offer. It's a forgettable experience failing to tap on it's quasi-supernatural plot, with just a few minor sequences sticking out from the otherwise bellow-average presentation."
46091_0,"Believe it or not, this film's plot actually ties in various racist/Aryan 'lost civilization' conspiracy theories about prehistoric North American 'Atlanteans'(or Lemurians or the boys from Mu or take your pick) having their plans for world conquest thwarted by an act of (a) god. Hitler's academia were supposedly fond of such stories, obviously baseless... or were they!? Yeah, they were. But the promised pay-off of an ancient ruin rising out of the earth is reason enough to co-op some pseudo mythology for your cheap movie. By the way, any ancient ruins? You don't see much of them. What you do see, among other things, are scores of interchangeable masked goons performing less than impressive gymnastics and making 'special ops' moves with their hands. Plus, a guy named Rowsdower. That was kinda cool. The 'hero' kid... not so much. The deep-voiced villain? Not cool either. Still, this movie has something to it, something I can't quantify... a unique Canuckness... and every idiot cliché in the book. They've already been listed in triplicate in the above comments, so I'll try to find something new to bring up... how about the obvious allusion to INDIANA JONES with the penultimate 'driving sorta into the sun-set' scene and the unspoken but palpable hunger the filmmakers had for someone to be moved by it, indeed, to hope for a sequel, an elaboration of the continuing adventures of ROWSDOWER AND WONDER GEEK. Or they could drop the kid. That'd be cool, eh."
46136_0,"Warning... This movie might contain spoilers, but since Im sure you're not going to watch another forgotten cult flick by infamous Ray Dennis Steckler, I won't hold up with spoilers (like there is anything to spoil!).<br /><br />This whole movie felt like one big deja vu. No, seriously. Whole movie is made from three scenes: 1.) The Hollywood Strangler strangles model (or how she calls them, sluts, garbage and ""like the rest of them"") and then goes of cooling playing with his pigeons(!?) or drinking bear all the time calling his ex Marsha (I think that was her name). Btw, his name is Johnathan Click and he is photographer.<br /><br />2.) The Skid row slasher played by Steckler ex-wife Carolyn Brandt (imagine that) who owns a book store by day and is well wino slasher by night. All she does in this movie is: going to the store to open it, staring at drunk, going for the drunk, slashing the throat or stabbing the drunk and then cooling of the beach. Yeah, I forgot to tell that she HAS to close the store every single scene.<br /><br />3.) Well I can't actually remember what was the 3rd scene...<br /><br />Anyway, whole movie is deja vu. You might think that you are watching the same scenes repeat over and over since all the killing in this movie are done in exact same way and all events are just repeated with different actors or actress.<br /><br />Another important fact of this movie is that it's a SILENT movie made in '70. I love those '70, those were the time (and '80) where you could put anything on the screen. Steckler hated sound and he also hated spending money on recording sound so he made a silent movie. When she showed up this movie to producers they thought he gave them some random footage of his vacation he shot while driving from the car. But no, Steckler was serious as always so producers decided to PAY HIM just to put some dialogs and sound into the movie. What Steckler has done is that he recorded lines and mixed them so it looks like we are in the mind of a serial killer (Hollywood Strangler) and narration in the movie are actually his thoughts. Clever idea even by Steckler's standards. Is there no sarcasm in my sentences? Not at all? there's a funny fact how the hell this movie was made. Steckler was on his movie-making class when he start discussion with students where he told them that he could make a scene in the dark with using only his camera and two lights. Result: He made a slasher scene where killer is slashing homeless drunk. Of course he got 75% of his answer incorrect, but who cares! THE Hollywood STRANGLER MEETS THE SKID ROW SLASHER was born from that scene! (since Steckler didn't want to waste all that used movie track he had) Why am I not telling anything about plot? Well... there is actually no plot except for the two scenes I told you about. There is lot of nudity, but no plot. It's a Steckler movie and you should know that he was PORN director in '70. He even used footage from his other movie in this one (from ""Plato's Retreat West"" the Rollerblade nude dance scene. Don't rush it, there are no hot bodies to look for here. Well, you might find it beautiful if you like to see naked body of a sixty years old virgins. I'm serious about this one. There is maybe one thirty years old girl in this scene which is NOT hot at all.) Bottom line: This movie suck like rest of the Ray Dennis Steckler movies, but if you are fun of his work you might like this (but you may not even if you are fun because this movie really sucks!). If you are a extreme lover of horrible movies check this one out, if not RUN LIKE HELL FROM THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />Ps. Don't be fooled by director's name of Wolfgang Schmidt, it's one of many names Steckler has been using during his unsuccessful career."

In 2009 we are perhaps more sensitive to the suffering of our fellow inhabitants of the planet and although I suppose the film is a masterpiece, I cannot enjoy seeing an animal given a slow and tortured death anymore than I can bear Hemingway's favourite sport, bullfighting. I realize it was shot with a false looking fish but it is not a good example for the young. There are so many wonderful sports for them to learn about. Teaching children to kill any creature that is doing no harm is, to me, immoral. I realize I am going against the grain somewhat, but I hope opinions are changing about what is acceptable on film. I know animals are better looked after nowadays when in a film and there are stricter rules to protect them. So much the better !"
46271_0,"There's a mystery at the heart of this abberation...why on earth did somebody of Johnny Depp's talent chose to cameo in this debacle? Unsympathetic characters, dodgy editing, bland caricatures and a plot line you'd have trouble filling a matchbook with. Our 'hero', Tennant is about as interesting to watch as a lobotomy on a gnat. To say he's uninspiring is a gross injustice to flat performers the world over. So here it is: Bradford undertaker decides to follow LA chick back to her homeland...and?...motivation?...development? That would be asking too much. Question: Vincent Gallo, Julie Delpy, what on earth were you thinking of? This insipid piece of self indulgent flatulence should have been strangled in the editing room, I say editing room loosely. It feels like the producers shipped the editing duties out to a first term film student...there are plenty of bad films out there, thankfully this one has been hidden in amongst the other dross on cable pay TV. The likes of Gallo, Delpy and Depp must cringe whenever this one is half remembered."
46316_0,"I was confused reading one after another so laudatory reviews; I began thinking that I really wasn't paying attention when they aired the show. But then, I found a review from Canadian blogger Geno Sajko, who resumes EXACTLY the outstanding feature I most remember about the show: ""... they have kids doing stupid things getting them into trouble (taking the show to a attempted comedic level), and characters who acted so stupidly - not believably. Too many episodes around some dumb tw*t doing something stupid after being asked not to, thus costing time, food, supplies etc, then rescuing them."" <br /><br />In a hostile or at least unknown environment, people acted like they were strolling through a Kentucky prairie. The Martin couple behaved like Lost in Space's Dr. Smith, always furthering their own agenda and finally creating problems for all, themselves included.<br /><br />My vague -and perhaps mistaken- recollections also include an absence of visual attractions: In my mind, people are walking all the time on dirt; all around looked like brown dust, and that's all there was.<br /><br />Actors were excellent (and often gorgeous), but the characters were unable to gain my sympathy."
46361_0,"I found this movie an insult to the southern culture, and like all Altman movies, an arrogant jab at anyone living between the two coasts. I remembered when this piece of crap premiered, I heard the good people of Nashville were mad as hell at the obvious insult to their city and state. So I went to see it just to see if they were over reacting. They weren't. Altman and his ilk, think all of us who live in the ""fly over"" states are a bunch of backward rubes who just don't get it, cause we vote republican. <br /><br />The casting was a joke, and the music worse. This was Hollywood country. This had nothing to do with Nashville or the country music culture. This was Country as seen through the eyes of the Hollywood culture. Why cast a bunch of yankees and west coast ""progressives"" to portray southerners, unless you're satirizing them. All I saw was a bunch of second rate actors dressed up as clowns, pokin fun at the backward hillbillies of Tennessee.<br /><br />Just as M*A*S*H was a jab at the military culture, Nashville was no more than a laugh at the country music culture of the South. So yuk it up while you can. Hollywood and the mainstream media won't always wield the power of influence over our culture."
46406_0,"A bald, commanding Kevin Bowen, his calm tenor carrying an edge of danger, offers Reginald an answer. ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what Doom House is. You have to see it for yourself."" Actually, you can explain what it is, it's just not as much fun as showing off images borrowed from Metropolis and covers of Amazing Stories magazines. Simply put, life is a virtual-reality dream controlled by a master artificial intelligence, a computer ruling the world in the conspiracy to end all conspiracies. Kevin is a rebel leader in the post-apocalyptic physical world of the future who staged guerrilla forays into the virtual world of the computer, and Reginald is the hope, the future, the answer to a prophecy. Richard Kyanka as cybermessiahGod help us all.<br /><br />Drawing on everything from Colossus: The Forbin Project to Tron to The Terminator, Richard Kyanka proceed to turn the world as we know it into a virtual-reality landscape with a tech-noir look (lit with a sickly green hue, like the glow of an old IBM computer screen) and the physics of a video game. Kevin, playing Obi-Wan Kenobi to Reginald's Luke Skywalker, trains his prot&#39401; in the virtual world; they become kung fu masters in a cyberdojo in a marvelous sequence that combines the ballet elegance and furious moves of Hong Kong movies (courtesy of fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, a martial arts maestro and former Jackie Chan director) with computer effects and tricked-up camera work.<br /><br />Clearly Richard is more interested in his cinematic toys than his story. With a nod to John Woo, they stage a bullet-riddled showdown that lovingly records every spent shell that spills to the ground in slow motion. Later, a helicopter crashes into a great glass skyscraper, and shock waves roll across the surface like a pulse across a sea of silver. They've obviously put a lot of thought into the look and feel of the film, and the result is a consistently handsome, often quite elegant action movie.<br /><br />Would that they put that much thought into the story. The rules of the universe blur in the frenzy of bullets and kung fu fighting and all questions of fate and free will are cut loose. Kyanka, his vacant expression and breathless surfer dude delivery still intact, reveals the Promised One to be a Zen master virtual-reality gamer. For all its half-baked philosophy and cyberpunk grounding, Doom House is less a vision of cyberconspiracy dystopia than a really cool computer game. Given that, it's the most stylish, inventive, kinetically dynamic computer game to play across movie screens in a long time."
46451_0,"With the exception of Sam Bottoms and Essence Atkins the acting was horrible (who is the Jade Person and this Robert Glen Keith? Were they simply reading off of cards?) and the writing was sophomoric, the photography was actually good in places, but not good enough to save this flop."
46497_0,"So this movie has been on my radar for quite a while. I was smooth talked by Justin Mark's assurance that his treatment of the movie was respectful and to be prepared for a new era of gaming films. I was pumped and on board, and then... I saw the film. THE GOD-AWFUL The script from this movie was a joke. When Bison utters something about milk and expiry dates, I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, but it was laughter. This movie makes no sense to me at all. The pitch was it was a Chun Li story about looking beyond revenge. In the end, she gets her revenge and the moral is? Revenge is the answer. THE BAD The costumes in this movie can also suck it. I felt terrible for Kristin in the night club scene, wearing a ridiculous dress and using her feminine wiles ( primo top dollar dancing to the unaware) to lure Cantana, a lesbian associate of Bison, into a bathroom. The pacing of this movie was dreadful, and we are hand-held for every scene, if Chun Li is walking on the screen she will undoubtedly inform us ""I was walking.."" ... REALLY? Really. THE UGLY The truth is this movie insults movie goers, gamers, and people, in general. Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li, even though she had a privileged life, and a loving mother? How is she a victim of circumstance? Am I supposed to feel Vega's threatening persona through five minutes of him getting the crap kicked out of him? Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter? I think this movie was seriously edited so terribly, whatever good there was to salvage was lost on the cutting room floor. Whoever edited this needs to be bird kicked in the throat. It just makes no sense to me how the editor could do his job, watch the movie and allow this to enter the theaters. The best parts of the movie involved subtitles, and a sunset. That is it. So there you go, street fighter 2? Most assuredly, not."
46541_0,"Hi there..<br /><br />I echoed a very positive review for this film when I watched it and completely because I had not seen the Rekha starer Umrao Jaan.<br /><br />I felt the songs were nice too, if not exceptional. and Aishwarya looked breath taking angelic. She performed really good, especially in scenes like the one where she tells Sunil Shetty that she will only be a dame for him (after the song 'main na mil skun jo tum se') and towards the end when she tells Puru Rajkumar that she has forgiven him and the scenes that follow and many more.<br /><br />Yes the film was pretty slow paced and to be honest, I did yawned once or twice.<br /><br />But now the main question arises that ""Did it live up to the 1981 Classic made by Muzzaffar Ali?"". This is very wrong though but very obvious and unavoidable also.<br /><br />So to know that I ordered the previous film from my Neighbourhood DVD Library.<br /><br />And my whole opinion changed.<br /><br />The 1981 film by Muzaffar Ali with Rekha in the title role is humongous in every department and J.P.Dutta's version now appears to me as an arrogant film-making by a director.<br /><br />I remember Dutta saying in interviews that his a true adaptation of the book Umrao Jaan Ada by Mirza Hadi Ruswa and it is adapted by his father. If that is the case, then I believe Muzaffar Ali is a fantastic story-writer and screenplay-writer.<br /><br />The story of the new film is a merely 50% of the old film. The Rekha starer has more to it and that too in less screen time. There are layers and layers of drama which indulges the viewer into the story of the protagonist, making you cry for the doomed fate of her in every span of her lifetime.<br /><br />The story being the biggest strength give ample area for other departments to excel too. The music is timeless, lyrics very simple and extremely effective, the old word charm (the film was short in the real by lanes of Lucknow) and the performances are superlative.<br /><br />Rekha excelled the beautiful story by adding her talent and grace to it.<br /><br />I guess the power of old Umrao Jaan lies in the true fact that Muzzafar Ali was a witness to the culture and Dutta was not.<br /><br />I never once felt the old film slow and dragging (considering I watched it without any break) and I yawned may times in the new film which was presented to me with inter-mission.<br /><br />Nothing is therefore of a match between the two films. Even Aishwarya's performance gets reduced to pail due to the failure of the new film at the scripting level.<br /><br />I personally aspire to be a film director one day and this whole experience taught me a lesson in responsible film-making and arrogant film-making.<br /><br />To rate the film is now very difficult. It certainly does not comes half closer to the Old Classic and so a less than 5 is deserving. It hence gets a 3 out of 10, 95% of it because of Aishwarya's portrayal.<br /><br />I know that many people must have worked very hard on this film, but am sorry to all of them. I Do!"
46587_0,"Last Gasp of the Giallo genre by the end of the 70's, ""Ursula's sister"" will be on top of the list of european trash & sleaze fans. But boy this one was tragically bad & boring.<br /><br />It's an utterly lacklustre attempt to mix sex & violence. From an uninteresting story (two sisters going on vacation by the sea are fighting over their father & mother relationship while a maniac kills young girls with a huge dildo (!!!!) right after they made love), Enzo Milioni's effort has a reminiscence of Jess Franco's early 70's works (The Bare Breasted Countess or Lady dracula) but with no talent shown. I rarely use my fast forward option on my remote but here I found a pure gem. Neverending dialogues by the sea, uneffective editing killing most of the suspense, cars chases at 50m/h that last at least 4 minutes (even with the beautiful sights of the Amalfi coast)are really too much for me. <br /><br />Bad acting, bad dubbing... only Barbara Magnolfi seems out of this world, her eyes lost as if she didn't actually realize what she was doing. Even handsome Marc Porel at his worst is in this huge pile of crap.<br /><br />Except the hotel location and the deep blue sea, it seems obvious that the budget was low, so were the expectations of the producers, I guess. But the TV-like cinematography doesn't help at all.<br /><br />The only different thing are the sex scenes : they're all on the verge of an hardcore movie. Which is strange for an italian thriller of 1978. But besides the excitement for male straight viewers, it doesn't bring anything to this flick. It's not even titillating as the actresses & actors don't seem to believe in what they do. It's pure Sexploitation and totally useless...and not even fun!<br /><br />On the top of all this nonsense, the score is simply atrocious. Horrible 70's italian muzak : mix of bad funk and Morriconesque women vocalizing surrounded. The murders scenes (no gore at all, by the way -not enough budget) are mixed with a tremendously funny violin that tones down all the thrill you might get. Oh, and there's the song sung by Yvonne Harlow (what a pseudo!) with the worst lipsync in all movie history. Gotta be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Sexist stuff & simply trash...Just plain boring & insulting for the viewer.<br /><br />Superwonderscope says 2<br /><br />"
46631_0,"This is an ""art film"" narrative gone wrong. While I appreciated the cinematography, I am afraid that this element alone is not enough to succeed to make a commercially viable film. One needs a story that elicits some kind of reaction. It is as if the actors sleepwalked through this film. Keira Knghtly, while attractive and talented enough, was particularly ill - suited for this film. Michael Pitt was, well, kind of lazy - at best. I do not want to get a posting that says ""spoiler"" - but I truly mean that this film was simply surprisingly completely ""vacuous."" Even the 'period' town was inauthentic. These producers raised a lot of money and produced a very very dull uninteresting film. While this is not a crime -- maybe it should be. We wait and wait but nothing really ever happens . . . and throughout, I am afraid to say, the lead actor mumbles his way through about 109 minutes of profound pain for the viewer. SILK could be an insomniac's newest best friend."
46677_0,"Hmm, that should sum it up right there, but I'll go into more detail. Okay, the story was pathetic. The Chinese randomly blow up a Russo/American space station and of course the two nations react and come close to a war with China. This somehow causes two alien objects to come up out of the ground, one that heals and one that destroys. When the waves of each of these collide, the earth would be re-terraformed and start over without humans. The only way that these aliens will leave is if they see their son that they got by impregnating Dr. Mason Rand's (David Keith) wife 10 years ago. Of course, they wait till the last couple minutes to bring his son, who also has healing powers and can bring people back to life. The acting was pitiful, I'll go over some huge standouts in a segment I like to call: What I Learned From This Movie:<br /><br />1. When soldiers are shooting at an armed enemy, they stand out in open space and fire randomly.<br /><br />2. Soldiers can look intimidating with their guns, but if you get into martial arts moves, they collapse.<br /><br />3. When shot in the leg, people can keep walking without noticing it for five seconds.<br /><br />4. Even though the aliens are 2-3 feet tall, the passageways to their structure is conveniently sized for humans to be comfortable.<br /><br />5. Ex-Special Ops cannot shoot a stationary target.<br /><br />The acting was pitiful the whole way through though. Keith did not have his best stuff at all. Not even close. It seems as if he tried way too hard to do a crappy job. The directing, to have at least that many noticeable major errors, is awful. He had more than that, those were just the first to come to mind. The visual effects were awful as well. The explosions looked fake, the Toris didn't look convincing at all, and the blood didn't even look real. I picked this up for a free rental because I thought it looked cool; that was a mistake. Avoid this one, you'll want your 90 minutes back."
46721_0,"There's probably no point in trying to describe ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie"" to anyone who hasn't already seen it or who is unfamiliar with the TV series on which it is based. Suffice it to say, the story centers on the highly surrealistic adventures of three anthropomorphized animated characters: a milkshake, a meatball and a floating order of fries who try to save the world from an assortment of villains bent on its destruction. I kid you not.<br /><br />If creativity alone made for a quality film, ""ATHFCM "" would be a masterpiece. As it is, however, the film feels like something somebody came up with while tripping out on some really bad LSD. And indeed if one were actually ON acid while watching it, the movie might possibly be funny. Stone-cold sober, however, one can only sit in poker-faced silence marveling at the fact that there must actually be an audience somewhere out there for this thing. With its bawdy humor, foul-mouthed language and (sometimes admirable) political incorrectness, it clearly isn't intended for young children (parents beware). In fact, its post-modern detachment and minimalist animation (as well as the title) suggest that its target audience is young adolescents feeling their first stirrings of rebellion and puberty, a time when even the most commonplace, unsophisticated vulgarity can seem forbidden, hilarious and daring.<br /><br />The movie borrows much of its style from animated hits like ""The Simpsons,"" ""Beavis and Butthead,"" and ""South Park,"" the only difference being that those works are actually funny while this is not. One word of advice: if you do plan on watching this, make sure to do so with the subtitles turned on. That is the only way to get all of the dialogue which, thanks to the intense mumbling of the characters, is about 50% incomprehensible otherwise. On second thought, given the quality of the writing, missing half of what is being said may not be such a bad thing after all."
46767_0,"Because of the warning of gratuitous violence with the provision that ""no one under 17 will be admitted"", I found myself stumbling into this movie on the Classic Television Showbiz site. It concerns a struggling painter (director Abel Ferrara) who lives with two women-one his lover who left her husband and another a druggie who's the other woman's lover and hangs with a punk band that just moved in another apartment room-as he tries to fight his demons by drilling holes into many homeless men that live below. There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons. Knowing this director later made the cult movie Ms. 45, which I have yet to watch, I approached this movie with some interest but I'd only recommend The Driller Killer if you're interested in anything Mr. Ferrara made and not if you want to watch a slasher flick (though those drill scenes can be fascinating to watch)."
46811_0,"The film was reasonably well filmed and reasonably edited and it's great that there is now a film out there about a synth pioneer.<br /><br />However my first thoughts on watching this film are: It repeats itself far too many times. It only needed to mention that Moog synths were first used for experimental music and adverts once. It only needed to show Bob Moog with his garden once! And there only needed to be one section on his philosophies on life and synthesisers.<br /><br />There were massive sections of the Moog story missing. What about the first fall of Moog Music in the early 80s and the Moog Liberation (the first guitar synth - only problem was it was too heavy to hold!) He only touched on his feelings about digital synthesisers. What about the 80s and the DX7 and Moog synths falling massively out of favour. What about the comeback in the 90s - initially selling his analogue circuit designs to other companies, who produced synths like the MIDI Moog and the SE ATC1. What about his FX pedals? <br /><br />Finally the soundtrack left much to be desired. All the live performances were badly recorded, the synths were far too loud compared to the backing. I know the synth was the instrument being demonstrated, but I found it uncomfortable to listen to. The content of the music was nearly all progressive rock musicians and various lesser known modern electro acts (bar stereo-lab and DJ spooky). He only mentioned Walter/Wendy Carlos in passing, he/she was the most important thing to happen to him and there was no interview or audio clip!! What about electropop, which was founded on the early affordable synths like the Moog Prodigy? These are just the first 2 genres that spring to mind that were missing - I could go on! So all in all - it's great that there is now a film about this fascinating guy. But...Hans Fjellestad should have got all the raw materials together before doing it. Get interviews with ALL the relevant people and use a soundtrack that is more diverse."
46857_0,"This film was supposed to be a film noir, except that the character development of everyone except for Tom Berenger's character was flimsy. As a result, it's hard to buy the plot twists. The characters needed more development -- most noir characters are one-note, but those notes have to be played clearly. If the, say, gruff but sympathetic boss doesn't come across as sympathetic, you care less if he is killed. (Note: this is a random example, not from the film.) On a side note, the lighting (or cinematography) of this film was awful, making all of the actors look terrible. In particular, Lori Heuring, who has an asymmetrical face, was shot from an angle that made her appear in some light to have a harelip and in others to make her look like she was slightly sneering (the actress herself is extremely pretty in other films, so I think I'm right to blame the camera work). Anyway, that's a small quibble with an otherwise bad film."

46992_0,"Only because this movie hasn't graced MST3K, has it not received attention as the worst of all time.

A crime film which becomes a mad scientist film, which becomes a chase film, and ends up as a zombie movie!<br /><br />I saw this on TV, and when coming back from commercial breaks, I frequently thought that I was watching a different film entirely. Both in plot and cinematography, it's like a film pieced together from ill-fitting parts of other films. A Frankenstein of films - at least in the method by which it seems to have been made.<br /><br />The dialogue is horrible and most of it unnecessary. A typical line: ""I flew in.....on a plane!"" That would be opposed to flying cross country by flapping his arms. I'm glad they explained that one, I'd have been lost otherwise.<br /><br />The best part (or worst)?

The lab coat would protect his delicate mix of monkey brains, goat lips, fish heads and guano from suit lint. The suit lint would ruin everything!<br /><br />Only see this film if you love bad films.

There was lots of submarine jargon which went over my head, so unless you have a particular history with or an interest in submarines, then I'm assuming most people would have the same problem... and so it got a little confusing.<br /><br />I wouldn't attack the plot too much because after all it is called 'Ghostboat' and so you expect it to be a little far fetched/supernatural so that's fine BUT... at the end when the Navy and the Russian Navy (or whatever they're called in Russia) closed the case on the strange goings on, there was no mention of and never any mention of, all the other boats they blew up along the way...and as for the hostile German aircrafts...well I can only assume that they were imagined? <br /><br />Now I know there were some grey areas as to which was going on in the past and which was in the present but Hardy did state that it was only 1943 inside of the sub and still very much 1981 outside... hence the reason why the Russians of 1981 were getting a little anxious at the sight of the sub on its radar... so I'm assuming that the boats they blew up were real and of 1981 too? <br /><br />But...if I did get too confused by all the submarine jargon...and completely missed something due to this fact...and anyone knows any different...please tell me? <br /><br />Thanks :-)"
47081_0,"The personnel in The Arrangement reminds me of the LA Lakers basketball team ( around the time this film was made) when they had Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor on the same squad. There were great expectations for a team with three superstars but they never jelled as a unit and were a dismal failure overall. Such is the case with Elia Kazan's The Arrangement, a crashing, sloppy out of touch melodrama of marital infidelity and despair.<br /><br />It would be hard to surpass the ten year run that Elia Kazan had a as film director from 1947-57. Just about everything he directed turned to gold and those that didn't then (Boomerang, Panic in the Streets, Face in the Crowd) have that respect today. In the early 60s he was still producing quality work (Splendor in the Grass, America,America) when he turned to writing a best seller (The Arrangement) eventually bringing it to the screen in the late sixties. Kazan, an actor's director if their ever was one and who translated the words and feelings of John Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams to film so well seemed to be at a loss with his own work and his ability to coax well measured performances out of his cast. Kirk Douglas, Deborah Kerr and Faye Dunaway are uniformly shrill from start to finish moping from one scene to another, making it hard to believe they could feel tenderness for anything. The scenes between Douglas and his mistress (Dunaway) lack intimacy and warmth, their passion forced. With his wife (Kerr) there is total detachment and not even a hint of why they got together in the first place. Kerr for her part seems like she's still in rehearsal. Lacking both sincerity and push she is badly miscast. Richard Boone as Eddie's overbearing old man adds to the disaster with complete over the top bombast, making a lot of noise and saying nothing that brings incite to the role.<br /><br />Having failed at what he does best (directing actors) Kazan goes on to embarrass himself further by employing some of the latest techniques (including Batman pop art) to be au courant in this heady era of American film but in his hands he fumbles. Even the highly regarded cinematographer, John Surtees flounders with sloppy camera movement and uninspired compositions. It's as if everyone attached to the making of the Arrangement suffered from talent amnesia. Kazan had certainly lost his touch and The Arrangement in one full swoop symbolized that decline. As a film director he had nothing left in the tank."
47126_0,"This film was a far cry from the book by Tom Clancy, who wrote about Al Queda terrorists reading a set off a nuclear bomb in America. The latter must have been sick watching this movie and typically-Left Wing Hollywood changed the script to being one with Nazis as the villains instead.<br /><br />Are you kidding me? How ridiculously politically correct is that? If I had known this beforehand, I would have boycotted this insulting movie, instead of wasting money on it.<br /><br />Also, at least to me, Harrison Ford will always be ""Jack Ryan,"" not some second-rate pretty- boy actor like Ben Affleck. <br /><br />The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off. If you have a surround sound, that scene will rock your room. Too bad, they didn't blow up this film before it was released."

The writing is something out of an afternoon soapie (though even those shows have enough pride not to hand out this many clichés, usually). Most of the acting--except Bean, whose professionalism apparently extends even to trash like this--is almost comically lousy. The only name I recognize (other than Sean Bean) is Amanda Donahoe, whose performance is so cheap it makes her crappy work on ""LA Law"" look like an Academy Award winner. None of the other actors deliver anything more than dull-eyed recitations of their bad lines, which makes me wonder: Are these actors all this bad, really, or are they this bad only because the script sucks so completely? All I can say here is that if you're a Sean Bean completist, as I am, you'll want to watch this--and then check it off your list. Be shocked that he ever agreed to be connected to such dreck. If you're not a Bean freak--avoid, avoid, avoid, because minus Bean, this has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it."

It is deffo frisby material but before you wang it out of the window it is worth one watch because you don't want to miss out on : What is going on with Bolo? The lead guy is a joke and is meant to be some kind of tough guy but looks like a mixture of Charles Bronson/Don Johnson/Columbo or whatever you cannot take this guy seriously."
47261_0,"It's a shame when a movie tries so hard to be funny but no one laughs at it. I went seeing this with expecting for a couple hours of light, predictable and forgettable fun, but instead of that I got a pointless sitcom that fails miserably at being funny or dramatic.<br /><br />The main problem with Rebound is that it never comes together; it's that kind of movie that is sorta made by two directors with opposite purposes: light-hearted humor and deep thoughtful drama. So, the whole film is like a struggle between these two visions, and none comes to win. Unfortunately, viewers become the great losers with all this mess.<br /><br />Megan Mullaly makes a good job of her role, though Martin Lawrence looks uncomfortable and overwhelmed by his. I have read some good reviews about Lawrence's performance, but I have to disagree on that one. I think that this is one of his worst performances, totally unfunny or whatsoever.<br /><br />For those who defend this film saying that is a kid's movie, I should defend children's rights to have intelligent options, like Pixar and Dreamworks had been doing lately. There is no excuse for showing dull and naive movies only because ""it's for the children""..."
47306_0,"I found this movie a year back in a collection of horror films from a friend. We sat and watched this one first, and we found ourselves cracking up. This film rotates around 3 young men, stranded on a strange island after their plane goes down. While exploring, they find natives who repeat to them again and again that there are ""zombies"" walking around the island. This is by no means a horror film. If anything, it's good for laughs. Some of which would be the visible strings holding up their ""airplane"" at the beginning of the movie, and a man who is convinced that he is a voodoo zombie. The actor for this part is very silly, and i'm sure that he was a comedian outside of this film. With one of the most cliché'd endings ever, a funny opening, and everything in-between, King of the Zombies is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it for it's ""horror"" appeal. you'll be disappointed if you do. Watch this film with your kids, if nothing else. There's nothing here that a 4-year old would flinch at. worth a buck or two."
47351_0,"Freakshow is set in a circus where Lon (Christopher Adamson) runs a freak show, scheming blonde tart Lucy (Rebekah Kochan) & her slimy boyfriend Lee (Mark Preston Miller) decide to rip him off. They devise a plan where Lucy seduces Lan, gets him to propose to her & then kill him off leaving her to inherit all of his money so she & Lee can live happily ever after, simple eh? What could go wrong? Well, Lucy gets cold feet & her murderous plan is discovered & the freaks want revenge...<br /><br />Directed by Drew Bell & although uncredited & unacknowledged Freakshow is a remake of Tod Browning's controversial classic black and white horror flick Freaks (1932), not wishing to put to fine a point on it Freakshow is frankly crap. The script by Keith Leopard is pretty faithful to Browning's original but with several changes, the basic story of a 'normal' person trying to exploit the freaks by marrying into their number is still present & correct but it's the character's which are the main difference. In the original the Lan character was a midget called Hans & he is presented as a naive lovestruck child, someone to sympathise with & feel sorry for, here in Freakshow Lan is depicted as nothing more than a dirty old man who wants a nice young blonde girl to give him a blow job when he wants, motivation which just doesn't entice the same sort of feelings towards him. In the original the Lucy character was named Cleopatra & again in a way you could see that she was evil but wanted a good life of her own with her boyfriend, here Lucy is just a slut who is used by both Lan to get a blow job & by her boyfriend to help him steal Lan's money & she falls for it. In the original the freaks themselves were proper character's, here they are just a collection of amputees missing various limbs, dwarfs, retards, a strongman & a half-man half-woman thing who barely feature. The dialogue is poor, the character's turn the original story from a sometimes moving piece involving real people into a standard low budget horror where you don't care about anyone & to top it all off it's seriously slow & boring with virtually no exploitation or gore at all. There's one bit in this I don't get, Lucy refuses to drink out of a bowl that the freaks had just drank out of fearing drinking their spit, however it is also shown that Lucy has no problem having sex or giving a blow job to a man old enough to be her dad & literally covered in warts & boils!<br /><br />Director Bell does nothing to make this watchable, the entire circus consists of three tents, one carousel & a ferris wheel which no-one ever visits! This film has the most number of slow, boring & utterly pointless fades to black at the end of a scene I've ever seen in a single film, it also has some utterly awful gramophone style 20's & 30's music constantly playing on the soundtrack to maybe try & evoke an atmosphere like the original 1932 version? The film is also shot in a sepia tone (again maybe to try & mimic the original black and white original) which gives everything a candle lit orange type hue, like yeah that's original isn't it? There's very, very little gore here, the filmmakers hired some of those masochist type guy's who hang themselves on hooks which piece their skin & can be found just about everywhere to do several hooks piecing the skin on their backs type scenes, there's a bit when someone cuts a girls scalp off, someone head is bashed in (off screen), someone is hit with a wrench (off screen), someone is stabbed with a knife, someone has part of their throat bitten out & the end sequence which doesn't last that long & is again full of annoying slow fade to black shots when Lucy has her lips sewn shut, the skin on her body sliced off as well as the skin on her face in a scene which is much less effective than a similar one in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986).<br /><br />With a supposed budget of $1,000,000 one has to say Freakshow felt like it had a lower budget than that & I wouldn't be surprised if it was. It looks grubby & cheap with horrible music, annoying editing, poor special effects & a circus which consists of about three tents in a field. The acting sucks as well.<br /><br />Freakshow is a terrible film to be sure, it's one of those films which promises much but delivers nothing. There's no gore for 80 minutes, the character's are awful & if you don't think that matters watch the original again & see the difference. It's throughly boring to sit through as well, one to avoid."
47397_0,"Blame it on me, but the only reason I wanted to see this film for was that Nastassja Kinski plays in it. So for this alone it justifies being fixed at the screen for 90 minutes...but for the rest? I really wouldn't know.... It all starts with Wesley Snipes who travels from LA to New York to see his sick buddy Charlie who is seropositive. Wesley has a perfect familylife, two kids, a dog and a lovely wife Ming-Na. Everything goes fine till he misses his flight and bumps onto Karen (Nastassja Kinski, with blonde hair this time!). Everything is innocent (they go to an opera) till they are robbed and madame Kinski begs him to stay the night with her as she's still dead afraid. And of course it happens... You can't blame Snipes, Ming-Na....it's Nastassja, remember? The day after Wesley flies back home and his life changes...the most interesting part of the movie by the way as the dog smells something...! Look I could go on and tell you the whole movie but that wouldn't be fair. Nothing more interesting happens and if it does it is pure Hollywood-nonsense (the last 10 minutes are even completely stupid). ""One night stand"" certainly isn't a bad movie, it even doesn't bore one minute, but it's just a bit too empty and you can't blame the actors as Wesley Snipes plays his role perfect but actors are bound to the script, a script that is a bit too much like those telemovies that are based on true stories. Watch it but expect nothing, expect...well you know!"
47441_0,"When I saw this years and years ago....there was a big gimmick.<br /><br />They advertised it in my area as ""When the screaming stops"" and said it was the most disgusting movie ever. So, everybody that showed up got an airline style barf bag and they ran a big warning at the beginning of the movie telling people the producers were not responsible for whatever happened to those who watched the movie.<br /><br />The movie was heavily hyped with lots and lots of ads on local TV stations telling everyone that this was the grossest movie ever made.<br /><br />So there was a big buzz and the theaters were packed.<br /><br />Then, of course the opening scene was of a tranquil lake outside some castle in Europe and people began making very mocking barf sounds...that was probably the most memorable thing of the whole movie.<br /><br />There were some disgusting parts (including one part where I think the bad guy rips an organ out of a body and if I remember right eats it.<br /><br />Pretty gross stuff. But it was clearly a foreign movie repackaged and expertly hyped here in the US. <br /><br />Probably made some decent money but many felt ripped off."
47487_0,"The only redeeming part of this movie was the sumptuous cinematography and settings used. Simply breathtaking.<br /><br />OK, now for the meat of it. It felt to me that Michelle Yeoh was leveraging off her dubious success in Tiger/Dragon and Tomorrow Never Dies to bridge the gap from HK chop-schlocky movies to something passably ""international"". Boy did she ever set her career back with this stinker. The plot was horribly derivative, and full of holes. The action sequences, albeit nicely choreographed, felt rushed and the fight pacing was jerky and obviously wired. The special effects were second-rate at best, with obvious seams visible and CGI clearly recognizable.<br /><br />Roxburgh and Chaplin did their best in the movie, and Yeoh was shockingly wooden.<br /><br />I had an attack of the giggles part way through the movie, and it worsened with the ludicrous plot developments, culminating in a full-fledged laughing attack when the Tibetan monk at the end spoke so badly they had to subtitle him... even though he was attempting to speak English.<br /><br />In summary, I feel somewhat insulted at having had to pay to see this movie."
47531_0,"Films like this are what is wrong with mainstream cinema. It was a contrived re-mixing of Gorillas in the Mist, The Shawshank Redemption and Dead Poets Society. The script seemed to have been written on a chalkboard - interchanging cliche after cliche though lacking a satirical or retroactive temperament. I'm not exaggerating - there were so many overt film references it seemed like a parody. The actors were designated by their collective wallet, not heart or mind, and the direction was simplistic. And you people gave 'Julien Donkey-Boy' a 4.5? Clearly the lesson remains: 'give us what we want' because the alternative is just too horrifying.<br /><br />It's this type of film, and this type of rampant commercialism that seeks to destroy the craft of film art, just as disco had to rock and roll in the 70s. See this film and continue to line studio-pockets...just don't maintain a pretense of superiority over those of us who give a damn."
47577_0,"I have given myself a day to calm down before 'voicing' my critique of this shoddy film. What happened to the terrific Matthew Modine? So much of it needed editing. The contrived situations, the change in mood, the ridiculous outcome . . . why? Could have been a fairly decent film, if only someone with brains would have stepped in and watched the dailies. Pitiful. Example: if someone is a teetotaler, they have ways to refuse taking a drink. Chug-a-lugging wine, just to bolster ones nerve, is extremely juvenile, and not in character for our leading lady. Why resort to gym shoes, when dancing barefoot has been the norm for hundreds of years. (Not that the wedding was even formal, which is another atrocity). Nothing jived. Scrambled nonsense. Only satisfying moment was when her selfish fiancée exited her life."

47667_0,"A low-grade ripoff of ""Friday the 13th"", (would that make it Friday the 12th?) starring the most aesthetically unappealing cast in movie history. On the last night at a cottage for gifted kids, Max the proprietor of the place, tells a story about Madman Marz, a local farmer that killed his own family and was properly hung by the locals for this crime. Supposedly he did not stay dead which is very rude and if anyone says his name out loud well, you ain't gonna like it. This is the cue for one of the counselors to immediately say his name. Not too bright. Marz returns to his house which seems located conveniently by the cottage and picks up where he left off. Surprisingly he does not go to a family crisis counselor and talk about his pent up feelings. The cycle of violence continues.<br /><br />There is nothing here to suggest that this is a cult classic rather than a cult wishing this was a classic. This is far and away the most ugly cast of actors I have ever watched. From pointed noses, to oddly spaced eyes, to terrible hair and bad mustaches it leaves little wonder why most of these actors never appeared on film again. If ever there was a movie to be broadcast in braille this is the one. <br /><br />The cottage is home for gifted children, all six of them, and must be an experiment as they are saddled with a bunch of functional retards as counselors. Every character in this movie makes the most boneheaded decisions that ultimately leads to his or her own death. The formula gets old quick. One person goes into the woods. Gets killed. Another person follows. Repeat until you're bored to tears. One imbecile actually tries to flee Madman Marz by hiding in a refrigerator. When the final counselor left rises above her monkey intellect and realizes what is happening, does she call the cops? No! She calls Max the old man storyteller that went out to the bar that night. Simply brilliant. Most of the acting gives the forest a run for its money as far as wooden performances go and the kills are lackluster at best. Still, it was amusing when one of the counselors stumbles upon a headless corpse only to query, ""Are you alright?"". This movie IS the ugly tree!"
47711_0,"I started watching this show by accident and have been watching it ever since. The reason is I am hoping for one of the family to emerge as a totally responsible person. The whole family from the father and mother and all children are totally dysfunctional. Every new character is the same. The one who they took in their home because his father was a marine (Martin) came closest, but was also a disappointment in the end. It makes a farce of any religion I know of, but still I find myself watching and hoping. All of the children falling in love with every member of the opposite sex they meet is ridiculous. I am reminded of an Uncle I have who was a Baptist minister. He and his wife were normal people, but he had four sons, all of whom became alchoholics. Both families make me wonder about being a minister with a family."
47757_0,"Opening scene mayhem introduces a formidable beast, a serpent with spiritual vengefulness. It can petrify victims to stone in Medusan fashion, and it can swat you like a fly too. Odd that it has Greek Mythological power, since it's lurking in the Mid-East desert. Treasure hunters and a full moon unleash the giant serpent to emerge and wreak more destruction.<br /><br />Promising start, but after that initial scene, this film decides it's a junior high school production, and degenerates into unbridled silliness. When the creature is unleashed, does it utilize its horrifying powers for a grandiose or symbolic attack? Like other monsters would? No, it just tears up a museum and a shopping mall. It also wipes out a bunch of ""soldiers"" who look like they trained for combat by playing war games with GI Joe dolls.<br /><br />The acting is painfully bad. Somebody recites a line loudly, and then pauses expectantly, as if waiting for a laugh track to be inserted. It reminded me of one of those tween sit-coms on Disney channel. The archaeologist guy (a Robert Downey look-like) wanders around with a pie-eyed gaping expression. He makes dumb quips, and he just looks weird. There's a stock nerdy geek, who has neon-yellow bleached hair and horn-rimmed glasses. The female love interest looks like she's going to laugh hysterically at any moment.<br /><br />The red-dress greedy rich femme-fatale wannabe girl deserves special recognition. Her tough vamp routine looks more like a shampoo commercial. She runs around with a big heavy gold staff, looking like she's going to trip over her stiletto heels any moment. One guess on how shampoo vamp ends up. And it'll seem way over due.<br /><br />About as scary as a Care Bears cartoon. For its unintentional humor, it's good for a couple of laughs."
47801_0,"I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, but I am giving it a 1, because I cannot believe that it deserves an 8.8, which is what it is getting this evening, mostly apparently due to suspicious ratings from countries like Slovakia, India and Australia. Not that I have anything against those countries, it just strikes me as odd that so few good reviews are coming from the United States. I'm not saying that IMDb's ratings are being manipulated by some sort of conspiracy, I am just saying it is odd. Anyways, rather than try and balance my review with what was good (the visuals, the 3D, the sound effects), am just going to say what really sucked. Can I say ""sucked"" in my review? Guess I will find out.<br /><br />1. ""Unobtainium."" Really, ""unobtainium?"" Was this a kid's cartoon? 2. Sigourney Weaver's confused and cartoonish scientist character. She's tough, she smokes, she has a heart of gold, and her Avatar dresses like Dora the Explorer. Also, why try and make her look twenty years younger than she is? I can't tell if they used CGI, Botox, or a ton of make-up, but she looked like the female version of the Picture of Dorian Gray. What a waste of talent.<br /><br />3. Hundres of years in the future, they can create magical avatar clones and transmit brain signals to them, but they still use flimsy wheelchair thingies? 4. Less than a half dozen animals on Pandora, and all but the floating jellyfish are angry and violent. Really? No fish? No birdies? No toads, snails, foxes, puppy dogs, kitty cats, mosquitoes, or anything but those half dozen CGI creature types? Seems like Pandora was populated by a relatively cheap CGI outfit.<br /><br />5. The trees all communicate through synapses, and this is supposed to be ominous, yet this never turns into anything compelling. Did Jimmy Cameron get tired of his own idea? Or was it to hrd to animate something more interesting? 6. Almost half a billion dollars to make this?!?!?!?!? 7. ""Unobtainium?"" ""Unobtainium?????"" 8. Cartoony tough military guy who does not have a clue how to organize a military campaign.<br /><br />9. The Na'Vi speak broken English that somehow becomes perfect English on and off throughout the movie. And the Avatars speak perfect English in normal tone of voice, identical to their human voices, although their bone structure is completely non-human?!?!?!? 10. Unobtainium I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This was like an extremely expensive and pretty kiddie cartoon. What a waste, and absolutely NOT deserving of the rating it is getting here."
47847_0,"This one of the most blatantly non-American fascistic movie I've seen in a long time. So we are treated with ET's living in an ecological paradise looking like a sixties leftover's wet dream. Notice that all of them are white and clean-cut ; apparently, there doesn't seem to be any opposition to this ""ideal"" way of life (no work, no music, no incentive, no arts, no nothing. Ah, yes : popping rug rats seems to be the only thing worthwile.) One of them is forced to go to Earth, though they admit they've been ""quite racists"" towards the earthlings. So, on ET's goes to Earth, and what does she do ? Nothing. Oh, yes, scramble the brain of some guys who doesn't think the right way, but in a playful manner. But nothing gets any better. Obviously, their status of Unbermensch gives those aliens the right to mess everything up. Of course, if they are so powerful, they could do something against pollution or whatever seems to be bad, but no, they don't mess with Untermensch. At the end, the alien messes up a football match in a playful way, spoiling the fun of the people who watch it (considered as morons, I guess.) Well, I hate football and rather go to the dentist than see through a whole game, but why can't people appreciate it ? But apparently, in this ideal universes, This Is Bad. Thou Shalt Not Have Fun As Thou Wish. Great. So much for open-mindness. At the end, the ET's finally go back, bringing with them some ""good"" persons (meaning : who understands that there is nothing better than doing nothing but raising rug rats in a perfect, white, clean-cut environment and goose-stepping no, they left that one out. Well, in the movie's world, those aliens can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. I'd rather listen to Faith No More with my Algerian friends than deal with their ""Silence concertoes"", whatever that is. If that makes me one of the subhumans (even if I'm white, so I have a redeeming quality), well, so I am and sue me. In France, the National Front leader is called no, don't call him at all, just boo. It is obvious that if he was a woman and a mother, Mrs Serraut would have found her Führer. Oh, and for those interested, no, there are no special effects. Though those hippies dresses"
47892_0,"This is one of those movies that really should have been better. First, take it for what it is worth - a jiggle film. Given that, the scenes are pretty risque: bottomless front shots of women and all that (that is, if you see the unrated version, I guess). The two female leads, Landon Hall and Ahmo Height, are both well suited to this type of movie. Height, a glamour model in her second movie, is particularly energetic in her roles. She reminds me of Lisa Boyle (Cassandra Leigh) from several years ago. Hall is clearly less concerned about emoting a performance, but then again, she's been around for a while. The men are, as usual, cookie cutter and unmentionable.<br /><br />What I think is too bad is that the movie set itself up for interesting scenes, but then pulls back to the basic mid-range bed shots for the lovemaking. Why bother? Height's romp in the inn's kitchen is a good example. Rather than going whole hog 9 1/2 weeks-style with the props at their displosal, Height and her female friend (Taylor St. Clair) bump and grind on the counter. Again, watching Height is an experience (all 3 of her sex scenes have a definite attraction to them), but couldn't they have done something more?<br /><br />Many watchers of this film will see other wasted opportunities. Given the physical talents of the cast, it just seems to be a waste to go to all this trouble, then not do something more interesting with them than what turns up."
47937_0,"Hollywood has been remaking a lot of movies lately with usually terrible results, and this is no exception. The scriptwriter has taken the original script, and rewrote it while apparently stoned or on coke. The original movie has an extremely clear storyline with no idiotic story twists, no decidedly crazy and astronomically improbable behavior like this one has in spades, and is excellent from first moment to last. <br /><br />This piece of sputum on the other hand will let you feel like you want to bash the characters heads in half of the time for being so stupid and outrageously insane. The most pathetic part of this movie is the fact that despite having state of the art special effects it can't hold a candle to the original, which had hardly any effects whatsoever, never mind special ones.<br /><br />True, it is not completely abysmal like , say , the day after tomorrow, and has at times decent acting. But good actors like John Cleese for instance are completely wasted in this movie, and even Reeves and Connely perform like wooden dolls at times. I won't spoil the end to you; I don't need to, it is bad enough that it will spoil itself.<br /><br />Script: Zero .. Done by a chimp and two stray dogs taken from the streets. Edmund North is rolling in his grave.<br /><br />Acting: far below average most of the time, sometimes OK <br /><br />Music: Music? What music? <br /><br />Effects: Made irrelevant by sheer lack of everything else... <br /><br />Directing: I would be ashamed to be affiliated with this movie, even as a janitor. In fact, I would be ashamed been seen holding the DVD at a rental."
47982_0,"I didn't know it was possible to make a picture this terrible. Not only is the movie not scary in the slightest sense, but also the bad parts of it that are often so funny in other horror movies are completely dull in this one.

48026_0,"""The Wild Geese"" presents a terrific concept, a cast of well-known players who work well together, and crisp cinematography by Jack Hildyard that takes full advantage of the sun-bleached African veldt. So it's a disappointment the filmmakers couldn't make something worth watching.<br /><br />Based on a novel by Daniel Carney, ""The Wild Geese"" presents Col. Faulkner (Richard Burton), a hard-drinking soldier of fortune still shaking off the pain from losing good-guy African leader Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona) to a cruel dictator years ago. But Limbani remains alive, and a British tycoon offers Faulkner big money to get Limbani out of prison and to safety.<br /><br />Burton looks about ready to keel over, but he's still Burton, convincing in his command, and he's backed up by Richard Harris, Roger Moore, and Hardy Kruger as his officers. Alas, the film never gels. Director Andrew V. McLaglen, good in the 1960s at marrying action-adventure and comedy, seems lost playing to a grittier '70s sensibility, and with a script that presents the mercenaries with one bloody setback after another. A message of racial brotherhood is advanced by Ntshona and Kruger with some jaw-droppingly bad dialogue, as Kruger's South African character, Coetze, drops his deep-rooted racism after a few minutes of carrying Limbani on his back.<br /><br />""We need each other, white man, and that's the way it should be,"" Limbani says.<br /><br />""You're beginning to sound good to me,"" Coetze replies. ""Maybe we need you. Maybe you're just the man.""<br /><br />Coetze's transformation is way too pat. Also pat is the way a fort full of soldiers is eradicated in broad daylight by spraying cyanide into a barrack full of sleeping soldiers. In broad daylight? <br /><br />Things don't exactly purr along for the mercenaries after that, but even the complications feel forced and unnatural. So do Moore's trademark groan-inducing witticisms and a homosexual medic played by Kenneth Griffith who flounces about the mercenaries' training camp and writes out a will leaving everything to his proctologist.<br /><br />Pluses include a key plot twist in the middle of the film and a sequence when Moore drops his smarm long enough to make a mobster eat a bag of heroin at gunpoint. Harris and Burton have such good chemistry its surprising they only worked together this one time. And the film makes decent use of a deep supporting cast of top-flight Brits, including Barry Forster, Jack Watson, and Stewart Granger as Faulkner's steely employer.<br /><br />But you know you are in trouble in the first minute of the film, when rocker Joan Armatrading tries to channel Joan Baez with an utterly tuneless ballad while a 007-ish title sequence flashes up images of suffering Africans. Never mind most of the suffering Africans we see thereafter are the guys being shot to death by Burton & crew - it looks like McLaglen had the same eight guys get shot over and over to save money and hoped no one would notice. ""The Wild Geese"" promises two-fisted entertainment, but what you get instead too soft-headed to work on even the shallowest of levels."
48071_0,"Going into this movie I felt that a documentary on America's debt crisis had a subject that most could relate to and had the makings of one of the great documentaries of our time. Unfortunately it fell well short of my expectations. One of the people interviewed presented what I would consider to be nothing more than conspiracy theories about the credit reporting industry and it was presented as fact. Also, the film got too wrapped up in the emotions of people whose lives were affected by personal debt and debt of loved ones, rather than tackling the inner-workings of the consumer lending industry, which I would have found much more stimulating. While I don't think that late fees should make up half (or more) of a consumer's credit card bill, I find it difficult empathizing with people that purchase something, then elect not to pay the bill. On a positive note, the film did bring to light the ties of large banks to some other businesses. While I have seen worse documentaries, the film did not do the subject matter justice. Perhaps they should have had someone on staff with more analytical skills and some insight as to the inner workings of the consumer lending industry."

I can only assume that a bunch of 10 year old's who've never seen the anime voted 10 a bunch of time.<br /><br />Do not waste your precious time watching this terrible live action adaptation of a GREAT anime series. Ironically, this movie does not do justice to the series at all, and in fact, tarnishes its name and may be considered evil by some."

It seems like abortion is only the mothers problem, but it is not! <br /><br />A bit of mystery, a bit of sex, a bit of horror, religion and spice... <br /><br />I think, people should watch this film to understand what ""bad"" is."
48206_0,"As far as acting go, this movie was the pits. HOWEVER, the story is slightly original because the characters get around on snowmobiles and are stuck in blizzard-like weather. I am always happy to see snow and freezing, bundled up actors instead of bright sun and greased up, bikini clad actors. There is too much California weather in movies, I must say, so this is a nice change. And you could tell that the snow and northern woods were real and not made up on some California ski slope.<br /><br />It was also pretty creepy how they added the Christian memorabilia into the plot. A giant statue of Jesus on the cross or a crying face of Jesus are both really creepy. Much more creepy than a made up Satanic demon or something, which most movies usually use when dealing with the occult. Although, I don't understand what Jesus has to do with the occult, but it still added a lot of overall insanity/craziness. When people have Jesus things all over the place, sometimes you feel like they will act without thinking because Jesus told them to or something. This is the feeling I got from the old camp in the woods.<br /><br />However, the ""devil eye"" ouiji board thing didn't seem to fit. They should have kept with the Jesus theme instead of entering Haitian voodoo into it. That seemed to come out of nowhere.<br /><br />Tom, the character that gets in the snowmobile accident, had a funky look about him. When he has sex with the ladies and they show his snarly face, I thought it was pretty gross and hard to watch. Good job with the ugly faces.<br /><br />Did anyone notice that nearly every person in this movie has giant, oversized front teeth like rabbits? <br /><br />The waitress at the bar in the beginning was really life-like and typical. I thought she was a neat character, though a bit over-acted.<br /><br />I could have done without the old lady voice narrating it. That was too much unneeded cheese. It would have been better without it.<br /><br />Overall, terrible acting but a good story that keeps you wondering what is going to happen and succeeds in using effective props/sets. And they get an extra point for using real snow. <br /><br />"
48251_0,"Only being passingly familiar with the story of Ned Kelly, I can say that, on a cinematic basis, this is a pretty good movie. The locations, cinematography and supporting actors are all grittily realistic, in the way that only '60s-'70s- era movies could be. Of course, that still leaves the woefully miscast Jagger. As the larger-than-life rough- hewn bushman Kelly, Mick doesn't come close to cutting it. As an actor, he doesn't cut it. The scene in which he fights off five gaol guards (with a hangover) is silly. And yeah, his beard's silly. The Waylon Jennings soundtrack (and, in response to a previous poster, this was before Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid) is interesting, but inappropriate."
48297_0,"Sadly, this is a less than stellar effort from those involved. As Ernie Reyes Jr. is star and director of the film, putting him front and center, I can only say the film gives the impression that he's one confused individual. This being an older film, he's hopefully recovered from whatever ailed him. Characters and situations are all over the map, there is a very malicious anti-authority and anti-religion tone to the film, and the usually sharp technique Reyes has displayed in the past is missing here.<br /><br />As noted elsewhere, there is little in the way of morality to be found in any of the characters or the film itself. This in and of itself isn't always a problem. But usually we witness an arc of some sort, for example Blood Diamond's mercenary character, the aging gangster in Charlie Valentine, or the cold hit man in The Killer, all undergo a redemption of sorts. Even when there is no apparent arc, for example Lee Marvin in Point Blank, Mel Gibson in Payback, Benicio del Toro and Ryan Phillipe in Way of the Gun, or Warren Oates in Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, the main characters are of interest and not one dimensional.<br /><br />Of course all of the above are exceptional films so you may not think it fair to compare them to Reyes' film, but I'm not since to do so would be ridiculous, I'm simply citing why the lack of morality fails to work in his film. Which may all be a moot point as sadly, the film pretty much fails on all counts."
48341_0,"Who would have thought it? My second horror anthology film in as many days. In this one, a paranoid lad who is having trouble getting to sleep at night is told three fairy stories by his weirdo uncle.. but with a twist. In the first, two witches are trying to revive their dead relative by getting their nephew to invite guests over, who they promptly slaughter and throw in a cauldron for ingredients. The second has Red Riding Hood becoming a fitness fanatic who is desperate to lose her virginity with her boyfriend while being pursued by The Big Bad Wolf (who just wants his medication back..) Lastly, in the best of the trilogy, Goldilocks is transformed into a homicidal maniac with psychic powers who has just escaped from a loony bin along with 'The Three Bears' and is on the run from the police. Yes, it is all as mad as it sounds.<br /><br />And pretty cheap too. Like 'Chillers' that I saw just yesterday, the production was obviously operated on a very tight budget. But that doesn't excuse scenes where the boom-mike thrusts itself into view or we can see daylight through the windows, though it is supposed to be night. Whatever else you might think though, there is some very imaginative premises here which I can only guess how the writer came up with. For instance, The Three Bears are now humans, with Baby Bear as a simple-minded giant, Papa Bear as a fast-talking midget and Mama Bear as the stern matriarch of the trio. can I have some of your stash, please Mr Screenplay guy??<br /><br />BUT (and this is a big BUT) the fact remains that this is still pretty awful stuff. It isn't frightening, the first two stories long outstay their welcome and the attempts at humour mostly fail miserably. A few one-liners stand out, like when Goldilocks is caught in the shower ""You were expecting maybe Janet Leigh?"" I also like the actor playing the uncle as well, who would rather watch porn on TV than read to his nephew. He deserved a bigger part than some of the no-talents in the cast. Ultimately though, this is one for those long winter evenings when you're drunk and can't get upstairs. If you're soused enough, it might just start to make sense.. 3/10"
48387_0,"This movie was horrible because I had no clue what was going on at any given moment. I bought this movie strictly because Julian McMahon starred in it and he was only in the movie for like five minutes which was very disappointing. I did look forward to his scenes, though which gave me some excitement. I did not understand the plot of the movie nor the ending. Jeff Daniels played a pretty decent part considering I paid more attention to Julian McMahon's little parts. I should have rented this movie first before I bought it. If you are looking for a lot of Julian McMahon scenes, don't buy this movie. He was only in two scenes in the entire movie and you hear his voice on the telephone once. Oh, and by the way, they misspelled Julian McMahon's name on the DVD cover. They spelled it MacMahon but at the end of the movie, they spelled it McMahon."

It had a wonderful premise: Wife needs transplant, Husband will do anything to make sure she gets it.<br /><br />However, the execution of the script was poor. There are numerous unneeded scenes of sex with A LOT of flesh (but no nudity -- go figure). The dialog was trite and not believable. There are characters that appear briefly to move the story along with no explanation of who they are.<br /><br />And the ending.

There is no substance to this at all. This not even close to anything that could be construed as a movie about pot. not even trippin' would be this fricken stupid. I would rather watch Miley Cyrus on the Disney channel. Posers and only posers would find this movie funny or entertaining. I cant believe that John Kranski was in this turd of a movie.

48567_0,"Ho Ho Ho, what a load of crap this film turns out to be. Watching this with my family I came up with the line ""I'm looking for Joey Nova"" as a running joke throughout the movie. Say it with that deep Italian, New York accent and you'll understand the attraction as a central theme in the film.<br /><br />Rob De Niro plays a aging cop looking for Joey Nova (James Franco), a young junkie with an terribly predictable connection to the cop. The moment De Niro reveals the connection, I felt so sad that he was asked to utter such a pathetic script. Watch De Niro's expression closely when he has to say the unutterably bad line.<br /><br />My family, including my brother who is a massive fan of De Niro (and why not when the guy has a string of truly awesome and unrepeatable characterisations from his early career) came to the conclusion that in America, you can always buy talent, but you can't make them (only make them fake them) drink from the putrid stream served up by Hollywood as ""cinema"".<br /><br />Only for those who like to bang their head against a wall.<br /><br />I'd give it 0 out of 5.<br /><br />"
48611_0,"I believe this is my first one-star rating for an IMDb comment entry, and the only reason I award it one star is that there is no zero star setting. I watched an extremely rare Greek made video of this film last fall and only now have found the stomach to discuss it: I gave up at about the fifty minute point, depressed, sickened and feeling used. This is a movie that had no artistic urgency behind it's making, it was just an attempt by some producers and distributors to cash in on a notorious XXX rape fantasy movie made under the same title, FORCED ENTRY. The plot for both is the same: Demented psychopathic retard working at a gas station uses the opportunity and in some cases house keys left behind by his female customers to rape, torture, and then murder them. Are we having fun yet?<br /><br />I have never seen the original version. Rape fantasy movies are about as useful to me as a hemorrhaging spleen or perhaps the decomposing carcass of a camel. But from all accounts the 1974 porn version of FORCED ENTRY is one of the harshest, most uncompromising and gleefully evil movies ever made, working as a sort of a warped commentary on the post-Vietnam era violence obsessed culture which bred it's lunatic murderer. Even if offered the chance to partake I would decline, I do not need to see such things when stuff like the complete H.R. PUFFNSTUFF box set is available, or the bathroom needs cleaning. Life is short.<br /><br />The XXX version at least stood for something and was an original idea taken to it's logical extreme; It is filth for sure, yet at least the filmmakers had the guts to get down there in the trenches with their viewers. By contrast, the 1975 MPAA R rated film is a dismal, depressing slog ""livened up"" by moments of suggestively sick violence involving things like the bondage rape & murder of a 15 year old girl who stops by the protagonist's filling station with a flat tire on her bike. The attack is not shown in detail but in a suggestive manner that is perhaps even more disturbing in that it allows the viewer to complete the images in their mind's eye. The retarded animal at the center of the story is a general walking disaster area, every attractive young woman who comes in contact with him ends up dead after being mauled & mutilated, and after about the fourth murder I simply decided I'd had enough. To this day I have no idea nor do I care as to how the movie resolved itself.<br /><br />The problem is that the film does not have the interest to be true to it's own convictions, and uses the MPAA R certificate as an excuse to back off from showing exactly what it is that it's target audience of vicarious sex criminals are tuning in to see. It is more interested in selling tickets than being true to its own nature, an incredibly irresponsible approach since there are some who probably took the suggestions seriously. We already had the urban legend of the service station attendant who uses the trust put in him by his female customers to compromise them. It seems to me that what this movie serves to do is provide a sort of blueprint to how you go about bringing that fantasy to life, but does not have the balsam to show the necessary payoff to complete the circle and evoke the sheer revulsion that the XXX version reportedly does.<br /><br />Frankly though, I have wasted too much time on this pathetic, stupid, meaningless and unredeemable movie. Cult DVD company Code Red is supposedly preparing a DVD release, and my question is, why? Who on earth do they think is interested in seeing this? aside from uninformed James Bond fans hoping to catch a glimpse of Tonya Roberts' tits, and the contingent of sick, dangerous perverts who get their jollies out of watching movies that show women suffering. If that's the best they can do for a demographic then they have missed the point of low budget cult horror with an erotic tinge: There are SO many clever, interesting and sick, demented little horror movies out there waiting to be discovered that there is no excuse for making this available aside from sheer greed. The notoriety of the title might ensure enough sales to earn back their production cost and make a few dollars, but it will do so at the expense of a lot of goodwill. Starting with mine.<br /><br />1/10: Complete garbage, without any redeeming qualities at all and that includes the early performances by the A-list actresses snookered into making the film."
48657_0,"Loved the gritty/real Manhattan / New York City scenes  somewhat like Law and Order or NYPD Blue. The sharp picture quality on the DVD was much better than if I had watched this show originally on a 1961 television. Many top-flight actors made guest appearances, and Paul Burke, the star of the show and who later appeared in Dynasty, was great. Watched several episodes from 1961 on one DVD: The Fault In Our Stars (a pretty good classic detective story), Take and Put (a funny farce), Make Believe Man (too ""dark"" a story  didn't watch much of it). Stories remind me somewhat of Twilight Zone. Since Twilight Zone isn't really my cup of tea, probably won't rent any more episodes."
48701_0,"Functioning only as an apt definition for ""hot mess,"" ""The Reef"" is really just an awful movie. The script, the voice acting, and the animation are not even a notch above film school amateur hour. In fact, a conscientious mouse jockey in his mom's basement could probably compose a 5-minute CGI short on his Mac with more going for it.<br /><br />""The plot"" does not matter as the similarities between it, ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""Shark Tale"" are so obvious that Helen Keller could find them. The glaring deficiencies in the quality of CGI, screenplay, voice acting and the feeble rip-off of other far more capable screen stories makes one wonder why someone at some point didn't come to their senses and ditch this project long before it ever made it in the can.<br /><br />It tries for some jokes but fails every time. In fact, I don't think I laughed once. Even purposefully bad groaners fail to elicit a chuckle. The puns are so deliberate and juvenile it's baffling that it could have passed muster to any adult sensibility. But, then again, even ""Howard the Duck"" got made.<br /><br />One of the key reasons there are no laughs is that there is no good voice acting. There is zero personality attached to these characters. Everyone involved is phoning in it and probably going for a paycheck to cover their Christmas fund.<br /><br />Movies like this make you appreciate the thoughtful craftsmanship of Pixar's movies. It makes you realize how vital the story and the composition of the script is - not to mention, of course, their vastly superior CGI animation. Even relatively ""bad"" CGI movies like Shark Tale and Madagascar have tons more personality and skill behind them than ""The Reef"" does. As desperately tired as I am of all these awful and cheaply made CGI movies about animals, insects, or both, at least most of them have some basic charm and a few jokes you may actually laugh at, thus in some measure vaguely redeeming themselves.<br /><br />""The Reef,"" however, has no redeeming value at all. Best to leave this one alone as watching it will merely be torture."
48747_0,"When I saw that Mike Nichols was making another picture, I was automatically interested. After making motion pictures like The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, he had slipped severely, making only a couple decent films since. So, naively, I went to What Planet Are You From to find out if he could stem the tide of failures.<br /><br />And, triumphantly, I left the motion picture with an answer: no, no, no.<br /><br />If What Planet Are You From? succeeds at anything (and that's a big IF), it does succeed at having a surprisingly talented cast and crew, for what otherwise represents a made for USA motion picture. Starring Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, Greg Kinnear, and Ben Kingsley, I expected something decent, at least from the last three. But, they all disappointed me.<br /><br />The story of What Planet Are You From is a one-gag premise: Garry Shandling plays an alien who has been sent to earth to impregnate a woman, thereby allowing his alien race to reproduce and slowly take over Earth. That ends up being the entire story. Never any twists, never anything clever that the beginning of the film indicated.<br /><br />The film opens with thousands of the aliens being taught what human women are like, providing the only legitimate laugh of the entire film. Then, Shandling is sent to earth, bumbles around, meeting the sleazy Greg Kinnear, who takes him to AA meetings to meet women. He meets Annette Bening, who seems to be phoning in her performance as a recovering alcoholic/real estate agent. She insists on marrying before having sex, and so the alien marries her. All through this point, every time the alien had tried to reproduce, his mechanical genitals made a whirring noise. Apparently, this passed for humor, because Nichols depended on this noise for about 30 minutes of the film.<br /><br />Then, they marry, they try to have children, are frustrated, and eventually she gives birth. Then, the baby is kidnaped by Kingsley (the leader of Shandling's planet), and the alien returns to steal it back, setting up a trite ending and giving the audience a merciful stay of execution.<br /><br />The film is a massive disappointment from everyone involved, and I give it 1/2 out of 5 stars."
48792_0,"The trivia for ""Poolhall Junkies"" says that the two individuals behind the movie spent two weeks on the script and ten years trying to get the movie made. Well, I believe the two weeks on the script part because the script is utterly wretched, but I don't know about the ten years part because this movie rips off ""Rounders"" to a huge extent. In fact, ""Poolhall Junkies"" is just like ""Rounders"" minus the great acting, the interesting story, the realistic dialog and the production values. ""Poolhall Junkies"" is a juvenile fantasy film about hustling and pool that never approaches the heights or depths of hustling and poker as depicted in ""Rounders"".<br /><br />The story in ""Poolhall Junkies"" follows Johnny Doyle (Mars Callahan)a pool prodigy discovered and groomed by Joe (played by a slumming Chazz Palminteri) to be a pool hustler. Johnny double-crosses Joe for reasons that I'm not going to get into because they're stupid, and later has to face Joe's new hustler Brad (played by a slumming Rick Schroder) in a high-stakes game of pool, while suffering from a broken wrist given to him by an angry Joe. Okay, we all know what the ending will be in a film like this -- its the journey that makes it worthwhile, and ""Poolhall Junkies"" makes the journey painful and nausea inducing. Not even an appearance by Christopher Walken can save this Hindenburg of a movie.<br /><br />The stupidity of this movie especially shines through when Johnny is having some trouble in the climatic final game versus Brad, who is revealed to be the 13th ranked pro pool player in the US. That's when Nick (Rod Steiger), the grizzled old hustler who owns the pool hall the match is being played in, reassures Johnny by saying ""Don't worry. I've seen his type many times before... they always crack under pressure. He can't last, so hang in there."" Well, no. Since the guy is the 13th ranked player in the US he obviously doesn't crack under pressure because if he did then he obviously would be unable to make his living playing pool for high stakes.<br /><br />And why would a pro-player work for a two-bit hustler like Joe anyway? He could hustle for himself if he felt the need to make pocket money, there's nothing to be gained by hooking up with a small time criminal. The whole scenario makes absolutely no sense, except to the scriptwriters of ""Poolhall Junkies"". And the whole movie is full of idiotic sequences just like this one. Save your time and your eyes and watch ""The Hustler"" again if you're in the mood for a pool hall flick."
48837_0,"I can only think of one thing more incomprehensible than making a movie from a bad script and that is for a filmmaker to base his idea for a movie on another movie that is terrible. Normally directors try to rip off good movies, like the guy who directed ""The Italian Connection"" based on the ""The French Connection"" (good thinking because sometimes Americans confuse the French and the Italians), or the other fellow who directed the porno ""American Booty"" based on Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty."" And if all else fails, do a sequel like ""Jaws II"" based on the good ""Jaws"" or ""Exorcist II"" based on the great ""Exorcist."" I could go on, except I will be going off track and forgetting to tell you about the time when they decided to make the terrible ""Return of the Blue Lagoon"" based on the terrible ""Blue Lagoon"" which must have had the makers of sequels and rip offs scratching their heads.<br /><br />The problem with ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" is the same as the last film. It is not about anything. It seems that the filmmakers felt, in spite of the bad critical reception of the first Blue Lagoon, that an exotic island and two teenagers discovering sex and then fornicating (though we see none of that) was enough to create an entertaining film. Of course, the filmmakers did a little tweaking for this film. There is the sad background story which explains how the two kids got stuck on the island, like the last two kids. Who says that Carl Orff's Carmina Burana does not have any influence over film-making. There is also an egg competition, an encounter with a native, a seductive English girl from the outside and a lascivious sailor. But other than that, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause) go through the same motions as Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins as though they were destined to live the exact same lives as the previous couple on the island. What ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" really is, if you think about it, is an unsexy pornographic movie for kids; a stage for kids to go through before they see the softcore and hardcore porn films. But even based on that sordid criteria, ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" fails because even the sleaziest, worst acted pornos at least do something to your libido. ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" does nothing because it has all the bad acting you would expect from a porno without any of any of the great sex (not least because the actors are underage). So if you are interested in a movie where a couple have lots of great sex on a deserted tropical island, watch Lina Wertmueller's ""Swept Away by a Mysterious Destiny in the Blue Sea of August"" instead. It has gorgeous pictures of a tropical paradise, far better acting, and you won't feel dirty and guilty by the end of the film because the actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, were both in their thirties (though they look like in the their twenties) at the time of filming."
48882_0,"The original Power Rangers TV show was a fun, much loved, admittedly tacky, but often enjoyable series. The first movie was similar in description, but I think it surpassed the show in several ways. But by the time Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie came along, I realized that it was just going on nothing. The film has one of the stupidest titles I have ever heard, and from that, we get more bad things. The actors are bad, but they were bad in the show too. The villains are the lamest and blandest in the entire long running series. And the turning a boy into a ranger. Blech. Why did they bother? It has redeeming features. Tommy, Adam, Jason and Kinmberly, my picks for the best power rangers are in the film (Billy, who is absent, is my fifth pick). The monster Maligore is bloated and lingually challenged, but cool.

Kennedy makes Pauly Shore seem like Laurence Olivier.<br /><br />I brought my 2 sons (11 and 13) to see this movie because one thought it looked funny. I'm a pushover for going to movies with them. I figure a movie with a PG-13 rating will not be crude or offensive, simply it will have a few curse words and possibly some implied sex.<br /><br />I think I laughed once and thought my sons were laughing a little early on. When they got to the part about teaching the formerly comatose break dancer some moves for getting with his love interest (using a short fat Hispanic ""actor"" with a wig and bra as a sex doll -- he looked like Chewbacca with that wig.

I was about to tell my family we were leaving, when my 11 year old asked, ""Can we GO, now?"" <br /><br />The rating was wrong. There should be a rating for offensive, insulting, pointless, no redeeming values. I only wish I had seen a manager on my way out so I could have gotten a refund. This is only the second movie I have ever walked out on in my life.<br /><br />I agree with several of the other reviewers. I felt that my evening out was worse than ruined (we bought 4 tickets, 2 drinks and a tub of popcorn -- easily $40). Time was stolen from us. If I were a fighting man, I would already have beaten the crap out of the people who released this movie. I also agree that the positive comments could only be coming from people who made money on the movie, or who are friends. This ca-ca stinks. ""Lex Luthor"" Rosenbaum was fine in it. Christopher MacDonald must have been paid a lot to stoop this low. The love interest was good looking.<br /><br />GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE. I'm getting mad just thinking about how awful it was and how much it cost for that lesson. I will never watch a Jamie Kennedy movie again, unless he's uncredited and I didn't know he was in it.

49016_0,"FOUR ROOMS / (1995) *1/2 (out of four)<br /><br />""I'm in a situation I can't begin to explain."" -Ted the Bellhop<br /><br />You can say that again! For Ted the Bellhop, things go from strange, to stranger, to even stranger in the comedy ""Four Rooms,"" a film that is really four films by four separate teams of filmmakers, all linked by location and a single character under increasingly urgent circumstances. When another character asks Ted his problem, his response is right on the money: ""Problem? I haven't got a problem. I've got f*cking problems. Plural."" One could also say that about this movie, a confusing, pointless mess of stale, unfunny humor, overacted characters, and a load of Hollywood stars and filmmakers so prestigious that it makes us wonder why such people would involve themselves such an unentertaining flop.<br /><br />""Four Rooms"" stars Tim Roth in a biting, fanatical performance as Ted, a bellhop working at a faded hotel. He is the only person on duty this night, and he really gets his hands full. In the first story, called ""The Missing Ingredient,"" written and directed by Alison Anders, Ted checks in a clan of witches who try to perform a resurrection but can't because they lack a certain component in their spell. Naturally, its semen. What other bodily fluid is there in movies these days? Ted is the only male around, therefore, its only a matter of time before Ted finds himself seduced by a bare-breasted witch.<br /><br />The next segment, called ""The Wrong Man,"" written and directed by Alexander Rockwell, is equally as bad, if not worse (it's a tough call) as the first. Ted walks into a room with a manic depressive lunatic who holds his wife at gun point to test her fidelity. Ted becomes the middle man, with no where to run and nowhere to hide.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez writes and directs the film's best part, though that's not saying a whole lot. It's called ""The Misbehavers"" and features Rodriguez's ""Desperado"" actor Antonia Banderas. He leads his rich, fancy family to the hotel, then abandons his two chaotic children to spend New Year's Eve with his lovely wife. He pays Ted five-hundred dollars to baby-sit them for a few hours. After a predictable hell breaks loose, Ted concludes this situation with the following reflection: ""There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuck in the springs of the bed. There's rooms blazing afire. There's a big fat needle from God knows where, stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what. And finally there's me, walking out the door, right f*cking now. Buenas noches.""<br /><br />""The Man from Hollywood"" is the film's finale, by ""Pulp Fiction"" director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino himself stars as an obnoxious Hollywood star who rents a suite with his bizarre arrangement of friends, including Bruce Willis as a man with marital difficulties. By the time Ted walks in, they're drunk and doing a replay of an old Alfred Hitchcock TV episode where a man bets he can light his lighter 10 times in a row. If he loses, he also loses his pinkie finger. This episode probably holds the record for containing the most four letter words in twenty minutes.<br /><br />""Four Rooms"" has reportedly been substantially cut since its disastrous September 1995 screening at the Toronto Film Festival, but it's hard to imagine the film running any longer. The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good. The film has a lot of energy, a cute little theme song and opening credit sequence, and Tim Roth is hard at work here, quirky and full of life. But he is all by himself, not supported by the writing--there are problems within his character. The key to a movie like this is to keep the connecting character consistent through his experiences.<br /><br />However, ""Four Rooms"" changes him from meek and timid to explosively reactive. It's hard to laugh at jokes about abnormalities when the main character is almost deranged himself.<br /><br />The four film's connect well, and I kind of liked some of the material in the closing segments, including the performances by Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino. But even here the situation is disposable and the dialogue is all over the wall. ""Four Rooms"" keeps us stuck in a series of stories that are not funny, entertaining, or engaging, but lackluster and deprived.<br /><br />The film was released on Christmas Day, which really amazes me. This movie is R-rated and intended for adult audiences only, containing everything from plotless nudity to streaming vulgarisms. Most movies released on this family-oriented holiday are, well, somewhat tactful, but not ""Four Rooms."" The sheer nerve of the studio to release the film on December 25th should in itself be a good sign of its audacity. Consider yourself warned.<br /><br />"
49061_0,"I just was dumb struck when I received ""It Happened at Nightmare Inn"" on DVD, it was packaged as a double feature with ""Legacy of Blood"". This IS NOT the theatrical version, it is in fact ONLY 67 minutes long!! The distribution company on this one is a bunch of liars and crooks, I do not believe in selling product that advertises something which is not true. The running time for both features is listed in total of 3 hours and 30 minutes. If ""It Happened at Nightmare Inn"" is only 67 minutes long, then that means that ""Legacy of Blood"" is close to 2 hours and 30 minutes (which in fact is not the case) Regardless, please do not waste your money or rental dollars on this version released under the title of a ""Blood Soaked Cinema"" release called ""Back to the Grave"" With the running time only being 67 minutes, then this must be the television version that played in a 90 minute time slot. It sucks!! There are scenes that just end, characters that just react to nothing, no blood, no anything! Entire scenes are missing and what is left is just talk! I can not even begin to mention how terrible the sound is on this, and they have the nerve to list Dolby 5.1 as an option..the sound is so terrible that I thought my speakers were going to burst! Can I say anything positive? No...the movie is unwatchable, the story is torn to pieces, it makes no sense, and PLEASE do not be suckered by this like I was."
49106_0,"I, like several others, was inspired to write my first review because of this film's blatant failure to deliver.<br /><br />Having been treacherously lured into watching this film by some of my ""friends"" with the premise of its potent quality, I was genuinely shocked at how disappointing and frankly boring it was.<br /><br />Let us clarify something. What constitutes a ""good"" or ""bad"" movie is quite relative. However, *all* good movies share basic elements that provide the foundation for making them good. Superior movies introduce these elements with such dynamic tension and intensity that it truly sets them apart from inferior movies. For example, some of these elements can be ""conflict"" or ""character progression"" or even ""resolution of said conflict through a character's progression"" (the possibilities are endless!) This movie was lacking these elements. The plot is so terribly vacant that there is simply no conflict. Nearly all the events are unjustified or left unexplained.<br /><br />What begins as a somewhat interesting premise turns flat and dull early on. The big ""shock"" being that the two conflicted sides of Good and Evil are not so different is quite cliché and ordinary by today's standards. Decent movies that have touched on this idea at least possessed the ability to convey that message indirectly with added tension and development of suspense, where as this movie has its characters simply blurting out this intended message because the incoherent plot fails to do so.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the large scale conflicts are not felt. There is no clear dispute between good and evil. There are no more than four or five characters for each Dark or Light whom have absolutely no character development or substance and constantly give the impression of always being replaceable. The ""big"" apocalyptic event is simply solved by a 29 Year old virgin saying, ""I did it."" Ummm...WHAT?!?!? It doesn't make sense. It really doesn't.<br /><br />There are so many smaller plot holes that are never answered its ridiculous. At the end of this movie I find myself asking, ""What was the point?"""
49151_0,"This movie is one of the typical liberal attempts to rewrite history. It has slaves,Indians,Mexicans and mixed races. Events run from the battle of the Alamo thru Indian wars to the Civil War and then gets to womens suffrage. It's main characters are a rich plantation owner that is part Indian and his daughter who own slaves and her anti-slavery friend that has a slave? and hates Indians. It tries to combine much to much political correctness in way too little time. Of course men are at fault and bashed every 15 minutes. Although most men depicted are wimpy and unrealistic for the time period. I have my disdain for men but I hate to see history warped as this movie depicts. (A regular housewife points out military strategy to General Sam Houston?) Please! Not to mention 50 raiding Indians 15 feet outside a house afraid of 3 women with guns they aren't firing? Half Indian rich plantation owners? I doubt it. Slaves married to Indians? Sheesh. And how did the Indian chief get 50 years older and the girl only gained 10 or 15 years in the same time span? I had to watch this film in 3 sittings as it was laughable to the point of disgust."
49197_0,I've read quite a few good reviews on this movie and I just can't understand why. Now I know foreign horror films tend to have some very bad acting. (which this one does)And they pride themselves on being very atmospheric. (one of the few plusses with this movie) But why must they be so damn disjointed. It's like the editting is performed by someone having seizures. The movie is all over the place and totally incoherent. Maybe it's just me but most Italian horror flics seem to have the same problems. They make little sense. I bought this movie on sale and I was still robbed! SPOILER: The model airplane death scene has to be one of the lamest deaths I've ever witnessed! The old lady ought to be put in a home though the son was good for a few chuckles. The only really intense scene was the nun being killed by the scissors. And the ending.... doesn't exist!! What the hell is this movie about??? Terrible movie... avoid at any and all costs!!!
49241_0,"*** May contain spoilers*** Wow. This movie is really bad. It's so bad that the first word of the title is misspelled (I'd be willing to allow for the possibility of it being some awful pun if everything else didn't suggest that it was out of the intellectual league of the producers to allow for this. Also, the song of the same name in the movie indicates that it's supposed to be ""pray""). The drummer, guitarist, and bassist were all well-cast and were pretty good in their roles... but the main character, played by Gina Gershon, is such a monumental bitch, it's hard to relate to her or her world unless you're the most hardened, bitter, negative person. She has this perpetual scowl smeared on her face and is incapable of not sneering or radiating this fake bad-ass attitude that instantly makes everything around her turn to sh*t. Which everything does, both in the context of the movie, and in the meta-context. And the plot itself a bit ridiculous, considering that her bandmate gets raped, another bandmate descends into serious drug abuse, and yet another bandmate dies in a freak accident-- all within the span of like a week. Oh, and she takes revenge on the rapist, who incidentally, is unconvincing as a realistic portrayal of a deranged nut. Somehow it's just hard to take it all seriously, and worse, Gershon's character really has a way of ruining the rest of the movie, contaminating it all with her bitter bile.<br /><br />And then there's the music. Jesus Christ. It's cliché in this bitter ""I'm too cool for life"" kind of way, where everything has this faux sleazy, sneering overtone that's frankly just embarrassing to watch. There are some points where it sounds moderately interesting, but then Gina starts singing and it's all over.<br /><br />I guess if you're into the rock'n'roll narrative, you'll find something to like about this movie; after all, this romantic notion of being hungry and breaking through to the mainstream has a certain appeal, but I just don't think it's done all that well here, either in a technical sense or in story-telling. There are signs that the writers have some talent, and are able to convey things subtly, but the larger narrative is not very compelling or capable of generating strong response-- although you will almost certainly hate Gershon's character.<br /><br />5/10"
49287_0,"Hey, I just saw the movie titled in the subject, here is my review.<br /><br />The SIxth Sense marked the debut of M. Night's fame and popularity. The atmosphere and vibe that he created, along with a clever plot and a twist ending made movie-goers everywhere realize the importance of Shyamalan. He, to some extent, created a cult following.<br /><br />Now, four movies later, many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense. With the OK-at-best movie Unbreakable, people were wondering if he was just a one-hit-wonder director. Then, with Signs, there was some hope that he would make a comeback.<br /><br />But, then he released The Village. After he lost thousands of fans due to that horrendous movie, he attempts at making another good movie. He most certainly fails.<br /><br />The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in an Apartment complex. He, as the super, notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title. <br /><br />You see, M. Night created an entire ""Bed Time Story"" about how land people used to coexist with the people of the ""Blue World"" (the ocean). These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure, like water, as the Super points out. <br /><br />To help out the greedy people, huge birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land, and they must confront a ""Chosen One"" (no really, that is how the put it) and show them the way. The way the chosen one is directed will end up helping the land people as a whole.<br /><br />The Chosen One is, of course, M. Night himself. He can write, direct, produce and now act. He must be the chosen one.<br /><br />Anyways, there are wolves that aren't wolves, but are Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them. These Scants attack people from the Blue World, but not the land. But there are rules. <br /><br />The night that the Snarf (lady of the blue world, The main Lady) returns to the blue world, the cannot attack them. If they do, these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. <br /><br />But normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either, unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is.<br /><br />So now the protagonist, Cleveland must find people to help him.<br /><br />You see, there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer, the Guardian, the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can... or else it wont work or something.<br /><br />And the moral is that no one knows who they are. I'm serious.<br /><br />Anyways, the main bulk of the movie is Cleveland looking for people who can help, and being wrong a lot. And then he keeps stuttering. And it is annoying.<br /><br />This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. Many of the shots are out of focus and hurt your eyes. And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying. And there were a lot of unnecessary close ups.<br /><br />The writing is by far the worst in any movie. The Interpreter figures out what to do by looking at cereal boxes. I am not kidding. It hurt me inside when it happened.<br /><br />The acting was decent by many, but some of the people should not be actors. M. Night was pretty good, but his lines were kept at a minimum.<br /><br />Despite the absurdity of the Bed Time Story, every single person Cleveland told it to believed it immediately. And that is about 15 people. Just imagine someone telling you that a human that looks like everyone else... that doesn't even have gills, lives in the water. Nope, not happening.<br /><br />The only good thing I could find was the music... and only the last song. A few of the other songs were out of place and unnecessary. But the song during the climax was very well composed.<br /><br />M. Night should, in my opinion, stop directing and maybe pick up a different hobby. Like not directing. Or writing.<br /><br />Overview: This movie is in my top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was, but never laughed at the so-called 'funny parts.' Do not see this movie unless you like pain.<br /><br />Final grade: 3/1000"
49331_0,"This lackluster Errol Flynn oater qualifies as one of his minor efforts. Clocking in at a sheer 73 minutes, ""Montana"" doesn't waste its time getting down to basics, but the narrative has its lapses. One character shows up and then is gone without an explanation. The performances are good and the Warner Brothers production values are bed-rock. Seasoned western writers such as James R. Webb and Borden Chase penned the screenplay, but they deliver little in the way of memorable dialogue and there are absolutely no surprises in this formulaic horse opera. Some of the situations, like our hero being duped into riding an unbreakable bronco, are old hat.<br /><br />Basically, Morgan Lane (Errol Flynn of ""The Sea Hawk"") plunges his flock of sheep into cattle country in 1879 and the cowboys refuse to tolerate these sheep-nanigans. No sooner has Lane and his flock entered cattle country than the cowboys descend on them at night with their guns blazing death. An unarmed, young Mexican shepherd becomes the first casualty with a bullet in the back. The following day Lane and company encounter Papa Otto Schultz (S.Z. Sakall of ""Casablanca"") who drives his peddler's wagon into their camp. Lane and Papa Otto become partners almost instantly and the two ride into Fort Humboldt to peddle his wares. Initially, Lane receives a chilly reception in the Little Big Horn Saloon where Slim Reeves (Ian MacDonald of ""High Noon"") goads him into a showdown after he labels Lane a sheep-man. Although he knows that it isn't any of his business, a bearded, leathery-looking Tecumseh Burke (Paul E. Burns of ""Son of Paleface"") pokes his nose into the confrontation. The older gunman offers Lane the use of his hardware since our hero doesn't pack a pistol. Tecumseh warns Lane that the trigger is tied back and he will have to fan the weapon. Slim shoves the holstered revolver and gun belt at Lane. Everybody clears out of the way so the two can shoot it out. Tecumseh starts the countdown to three, but the bushwhacking skunk that Slim is tries to shuck his six-shooter on two. Lane blows the revolver neatly out of his adversary's fist as easily as he might blow out a candle. The ruffian apologizes because he insists no sheepman could possibly wield a shooting iron with such dexterity.<br /><br />""Montana"" features a romance between the principal players. Predictably, it doesn't take our hero long to meet, greet, and get sweet with cattle queen Maria Singleton (Alexis Smith of ""San Antonio""), even though she is engaged to marry rancher Rod Ackroyd. Lane has Maria eating out of his hand after he wagers that he can ride a bronco that nobody else has managed to stay aboard for a full minute. Sneaky Reeves whittles away at the cinch and Lane barely missing staying in the leather long enough. Apparently, the colossal loss of money that Papa sacrificed not only drove him out of his partnership with Lane but also out of the movie. Papa vanishes and is never heard from again. Meanwhile, Maria decides to lease Lane some land to run his steers on since he didn't tame the bronco. At this point, things take a turn for the worse for our protagonist. Inexplicably, Lane's sheep dog Jeanne prances into town that same day that Lane steps outside the bank with Maria with the lease for the land. Reeves and his cohorts expose Lane as a sheepman when the mutt goes to him. Naturally, Maria is furious, but what she doesn't know is that her fiancée has been two-timing her with the lawman's girlfriend. Indeed, the lawman, Sheriff Jake Overby (Lane Chandler of ""Samson and Delilah"") doesn't know that he, too, is being two-timed.<br /><br />Meantime, the ornery cattlemen cannot shed their deep-seated prejudice toward the mutton-minded Lane. Lane argues that sheep and cattle can get along together. He has seen it in Mexico, but the cattlemen don't believe him. Gunslinging cattleman Rod Ackroyd (Douglas Kennedy of ""The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold"") leads the charge against Lane and his sheep and bites the dust. The showdown in front street at the end of the action looks like a mild imitation of ""Red River"" with our colorful heroine shooting the man that she loves. Flynn was looking a mite long in the tooth when he made this oater and the alcohol had robbed him of his spontaneity but not his charm. He looks a little more heavyset than usual. Smith doesn't look like she has changed since their last collaboration on ""San Antonio"" except that her outfits aren't as flamboyant. Mind you, she is a bit more hard-hearted and tough as a cattle queen who lost her father and brother in the war against the sheep herders.<br /><br />""Montana"" doesn't rank in the same league with Flynn's more prestigious westerns like ""Dodge City,"" ""Virginia City,"" and ""They Died With Their Boots On."" In fact, ""Montana"" rates as one of his least appealing westerns. At least the Technicolor makes this modest western look good. Strangely, the peddler that Sakall plays vanishes inexplicably from the action. If you want to see a genuinely entertaining cattle versus sheep western, watch director George Marshall's comedy western ""The Sheepman"" (1958) with Glenn Ford."
49377_0,"This is a bad movie that purports to be an educational film designed to warn America about the menace of teenagers running amok thanks to uninvolved parents. However, like almost all the so-called ""educational"" films of the 30s and 40s, it was really a shabby little film designed to be snuck past the censors of the Hays Office. In 1934, the major studios all agreed to abide by the dictates of a stronger Production Code--eliminating sex, nudity, cursing and ""inappropriate"" plots in films (these had actually been relatively common in films in the early 30s). However, in an effort to sneak in smut, small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills, though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors! Such films as MARIJUANA, MAD YOUTH, REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS were all schlocky trash that skirted past the boards because they were supposedly educational. Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education! <br /><br />Unlike many of these films, DELINQUENT DAUGHTERS didn't have nudity, but it sure had lots of sleazy story elements that were sure to titillate. In this film, teens drank, used drugs, committed pointless robberies and assaults and drove like maniacs--all apparently the result of poor parental guidance. And as a result, kids died in this movie--and in the most spectacular ways! The acting and writing were almost universally bad, though the sequence where the judge tells off the parents of these punks actually was amazingly good--too bad everything else was pretty lousy. In fact, one character was so bad, so annoying and so gosh-darn awful, I nominate the ditsy blonde as the most annoying character of the 1940s--she was THAT bad!! Her voice was more grating than Olive Oyl's and she was practically sub-human in her stupidity!"
49421_0,"This was far too one sided to be called a ""documentary."" Really, it was more like propaganda! A little less ""evil corporation"" and a few more actual facts -- from BOTH sides -- would have made this a far more informational, effective film. After viewing it, I'm just insulted that the makers think I'm so lacking in intelligence that they can present this to me as a ""documentary"" with no questions asked. It is very obviously an opinion piece; label it as such! There are obvious appeals to emotion throughout the film; they could have been left out, and it would have raised the quality dramatically. There are several valid points made throughout the film of the problems that arise in corporations; it is disappointing that the makers felt the need to cloud those points with foggy emotional appeals. If they believe corporations to be so evil, present the whole story and I should be able to figure that out for myself."
49467_0,"Boy oh boy. When you see a film as laughable as this one, you know there must be a hell. Yes, we're back in dodgy Italian barbarian film territory, where well-oiled beefcakes duel with rubber swords against helmet-clad stuntmen who die without being touched. Obtrusive music lurks behind every corner, as our badly dubbed hero must rescue the princess from a fate worse than.. watching this movie again? He must follow the ancient prophesy of marrying her and sitting on the legendary Throne Of Fire before the day is out, otherwise.. THE WORLD IS DOOMED!! DOOMED, I tell ya!! Unfortunately, he proves to be rather inept at his job.. getting captured no less than three times and wasting the spell his dad gives him that makes his body invisible and invulnerable to everything (except fire, conveniently). Some 'hero'. The princess, on the other hand is far more impressive.. she can butt-kick for fun and finishes the film without a scratch on her, despite the fact she is only dressed in a bra and loincloth 95% of the picture. Meanwhile, an eclipse that looks suspiciously like a raisin held up against a light bulb tells our protagonist he is nearly out of time, so he must hurry.. it won't be easy, with all those boom mikes to dodge. Can he make it? Who cares, quite frankly. I'm more interested in the mindset of those who would waste their life watching this kind of nonsense in the first place. (Don't worry about me, I've already gone mad..) And if all that still hasn't put you off, get this.. Our muscular, tough-as-nails lead character's real, non-acting first name is.. PETER.

49601_0,"Viewed 28.3.05.<br /><br />I know nothing of the literary provenance of this movie, Sword n Sorcery not being my thing. But I do have the necessary ability to switch off reality and overlook the silliness of all the made-up names and fake mythology. This particular foray seemed glossy, glamorous and to promise much.<br /><br />Especially when the wizard shows us the cave full of ancient mummies of dead demons that one imagines are going to come back to life later on. For a starter he resurrects the boss-witch who passes through some great metamorphoses before wisely settling on the form of Tia Carrera. as ever, ineffably gorgeous dominatrix diva. Alas, she didn't get to torment men much and that orange hair-do was a total distraction.<br /><br />Lot of scrapping, well choreographed but not my cup of tea, passing by way of an ice-God's magic breath to a fiery showdown. Then I realise, where are the demons? Mashabasha or whatever her name was had kept harpy-ing on about her Hellish court on Earth but she just didn't deliver. a pity, because the static mummy-dummies in the cave looked very promising.<br /><br />There is one ape-man-thing in a very minor role. Not even a villain, so much as an incidental character.<br /><br />Maybe they mis-spent the special effects budget putting demons off the carte.<br /><br />Is ""Kull"" meant to sound like ""Cull"", as in, killing surplus livestock?"
49647_0,"Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what I am about to say to this made for TV movie. But, I paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster. The directing is really awfully bad. But, after I looked up its information here, I realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing. Maybe they don't have budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit. The director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldn't even keep up a rational continuity in itself. It keeps pulling me outta scenes. Maybe someone need to work hard on story line/ board. The dubbed sound is also awfully bad. My god.... Normally, I would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual. but, this time I am just mad , ""I really wanna hit something HARD."" ...Just don't do the job if someone can't fulfill it to its best.

49692_0,"My high expectations and enthusiasm for this movie eroded just like the lifestyle of Big and Little Edie......<br /><br />To begin on a positive note, Kalina Ivanov and her production team deserve all the awards and accolades they can get. The attention to detail, the resurrection of pre-squalor Grey Gardens and period settings is amazing. Kudos to the beautiful costume design too.<br /><br />From there, it's all downhill. Drew Barrymore is embarrassingly bad. Every line she spoke came across as if she had rehearsed it a few hundred times. It removes her spiritually from each scene. She never quite nails the accent, which becomes almost unbearable. There are a few moments where Little Edie comes through, but it's not enough to keep Drew above water. I wish another actress on par with Jessica Lange could have tackled the role. Alas.<br /><br />Jessica Lange was fine as Big Edie. No one else could have done it better, but she too came across as over-rehearsed and sing-song. There are no excuses for her terrible singing.<br /><br />The direction and soundtrack were very ""made for TV movie."" <br /><br />It's like that disaster of a movie Titanic. It's bad, it could have been so much better, but it's never going to be re-made again.

49737_0,"At the start of the movie, the idea seemed good enough, but as it develops, is just a boring story of an evil child that, when kidnapped by a very nice group of people (who just wants to get some desperate money to get a straight life and don't hurt the little child...blah blah), starts practicing his ''art of doom'' with voices inside their heads and a few spooks leading them to get killed. Sounds familiar?!... I rate it 3/10 for some good acting, but that's it. The story is absolutely predictable and done like 1000 times before, the plot is boring and lame as hell, the subplots for each character are so boring, depressive, and badly explored,that i don't think any actor could do any better with such bad material to work on, the dialogues are lame and foolish, etc. I couldn't see any essence on this movie, is just another empty hole in movie making. My advice is, if u'r interested on the ''anti-christ kid'' stories, there's a bunch of movies out there with the same basics, and quite more watchable."

Wyman looks great but simply does not have the wisecracking hard-boiled presence of the annoying Glenda Farrell.

49962_0,"This independent low budget drama gets good ratings for the characterization and plot. Even though it is a typical boxing movie cliché, there are enough twists to make it seem somewhat fresh and original.<br /><br />The story follows the adventurers of Dublin, a crooked boxing promoter who travels from town to town setting up underground fights and sometimes trying to fix them. He meets a female fighter, Katharine, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size. The two eventually team up, but Dublin's somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.<br /><br />I enjoy all types of fighting (the real kind) and consequently, I find myself being somewhat critical of film fight scenes, particularly when they involve obvious mismatches. The notion of a 135 lb woman fighting bare-knuckle with much larger, ostensibly experienced fighters and winning by KO consistently is just too much for me to willingly suspend my disbelief. The fight scenes are poorly shot, primarily because there are no stunt people and the principal actors do their own ""fighting."" The fight theme and fight scenes are central to the film and they are just not well done. I realize that corners have to be cut somewhere in a limited budget film, but this was not the right place to do so.<br /><br />The ending was just too sappy for me and I was disappointed that the writer couldn't avoid the Hollywood style happiness and give us a real surprise for a change.<br /><br />If you enjoy the ""Underdog overcomes all obstacles"" type movie, then you may like this film, but I have to say I wasn't all that impressed."
5005_0,"A psychological thriller maybe, but not a ""horror"" movie!<br /><br />An elderly couple move into a house that's been empty for years. Naturally the reason it's been empty for so long is because everyone has heard the tale about the ghost that haunts it......many years ago a young girl lived there, with just 2 servants to look after her after her parents died, and when the girl too died, the servants (a married couple) were bequeathed her fortune; as was her wish for their kindness. But when a young girl (Margaret Lockwood) comes to live with the Smedhurst couple as companion for the wife, the soul of the dead girl takes over her mind, leading her to madness and near certain death.<br /><br />Quite exciting, but marred by a few dull scenes. Good ending though!"
5050_0,"What a delightful movie! I don't think its aged one bit. Sure the clothes are different, the latest self-help fads are different, the priorities are different--but SO much still resonates today. The relationship between love and sex and spouses and friends. Human desire, and commitment are timeless topics, and they are explored with great wit and panache in this thoroughly entertaining movie. And the dialogue! Many scenes purely consist of the twists and turns of intelligent people in verbal games--some of the scenes feel like being in a verbal<br /><br />amusement park, going up and down roller-coasters of clever and surprising<br /><br />dialogue. The funny moments are priceless: the tennis instructor asking for a glass of Pernod, Dyan Cannon in the therepist's office--probably the funniest and most perceptive take on the ""therepy experience"" ever shown on film-- (along with Kirstie Alley's therapist melt-down scene in Woody Allen's<br /><br />""Deconstructing Harry""), the opening group therapy session in the beautiful<br /><br />California countryside, that first dinner in the restaurant with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice all declaring their love for each other in front of the table of bemused gay diners--it is a film filled with endless, perceptive and highly<br /><br />amusing details. Its a terrific entertainment. (One last comment--Dyan Cannon lights up the screen everytime she appears, with her sexy persona, her high<br /><br />spirits, her warmth and generosity, and that truly infectious laugh!)"
5096_0,"I remember when I first received that movie. I fell in love with it right away. I could actually say the script word for word. ""Keep your shirt on, she's coming!"" Sandra was fun and exciting in this film. Her bubbling energy kept me laughing and glued to my seat. I recommend anyone to watch it for some innocent and old fashioned values. For example when Kim Novak was preparing dinner and she had salad and lemonade all sitting there before her family was home. Now, how many people have actually experienced that? It takes me to the time when life was innocent and we could use the word 'gay' to mean happy."
5140_0,"Some bad movies I've seen in my entire life have been considerably good, simply because they've aged well enough to build a more entertaining purpose. For that reason alone, B-movies, or drive-in movies, or ""Idontknowwhatelseyoucancallit"" were never made on a gigantic budget compared to today's refined standards. Pre-millennium movie buffs laugh over these rushed out products as fun, enjoying, weird, and unusual. The reason technology hadn't been the cream of the crop justifies how virtually all films were created in the past 2-6 decades of cinema. Not so with CARNIVAL OF BLOOD.....<br /><br />Far worse than an Ed Wood production, this experience in bad moviemaking really shows! It does have some strange gory-looking material, including a scene where a head decapitates in front of crazy carnival-goers waiting for a ride, but you know it's extremely fake! Actually, this isn't a horror show, it's a mess! Couples argue, folk music is playing, people romancing, a buddy chatting to a friend for five worthless minutes, a woman getting struck by a car that looks poorly filmed.... What more is there? Much more! You'd think the opening credits was never a flaw for movies. Guess again! While you hear the sound of a heartbeat, those black screens with red lettering also has a woman's face moving her mouth and not voicing out a single word!<br /><br />Yes, CARNIVAL OF BLOOD doesn't make any entire bit of sense, especially when it is a B-movie, and if you get a desperate chance to view it, be sure to invite some friends or members of your family to gather 'round for an evening of pure ill-minded entertainment. Be sure to serve up some stale popcorn and flat carbonated soda for the occasion. Once you witness the absolute noneness of this perverted work of cinema, you'll find out that there are tons more cheaply made movies far surpassing its dreadful quality! GOOD GRIEF!!!"
5186_0,"It's Low Budget, Amateurish, and Simple. When I came across the DVD on Amazon I was only interested in buying it, because it had National Lampoons plastered over the front cover. When it arrived and I watched it for the first time I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It's the story of Adam and Eve, but not the story we are familiar with. In National Lampoons version of Adam and Eve Adam falls for Eve a beautiful college student who happens to be a Virgin. At first the virginity thing doesn't pose a problem, but during their nine month relationship and Eve's reluctance to lose her virginity Adam's frustration causes him to question leaving the relationship and the woman he truly loves.<br /><br />This is a teen movie so there is obviously profanity, fart jokes, and alcohol filled parties with half naked girls, but blended in with a beautiful story of Love and Friendship.<br /><br />The beautiful Emmanuelle Chriqui was of course fabulous in the film. I wish I could say the same for Cameron Douglas. I could sense he was uncomfortable in certain scenes, which made him appear like a poor actor, which in all honesty he isn't just a newcomer. Maybe a little more rehearsals and he would have done the part justice.<br /><br />I'd recommended this to all National Lampoon fans and possibly anybody who likes a beautiful love story with some fart jokes in the mix. This is a great first date movie or for any guy still trying to get his girl into bed.<br /><br />7 out of 10 stars."
5230_0,"I have always loved Varney's Ernest character. None of his movies are real pieces of movie magic. They are mere catalysts for Ernest to show his comedy ability. I believe that Ernest Goes to Camp and Jail are the best ""movie"" movies of the series but my favorite for general comedy is Rides Again because of the small asides that Ernest goes into during the film. I have no doubt that these movies are incredibly annoying if you are not a fan of Ernest but I love the subtle, unrelated to plot, funny without the movie, similar to sketch humor moments in Rides Again that shows some of the best Varney humor. ""Blasting caps, that'll scare them, a brain is terrible thing to waste, map, map, where's the map, oh come now don't tell me you've lost that bloody map, oh no sir, that maps around here somewheres"" all done in three different pirate voices."
5276_0,"""Der Untertan"" (1951), directed by star-director Wolfgang Staudte, is based on a novel by Heinrich Mann (1871-1950) as ""Der Blaue Engel"" (1930), directed by Josef Von Sternberg, is. While in ""Der Blaue Engel"", the protagonist is a person who cannot adapt to the world around him, and when he tries, shamefully stumbles and at the end pays his attempts with his life, the main figure in ""Der Untertan"" is so-to-say the complimentary character: Although born in an aristocratic, high-class family, surrounded by the world-literature and regular house-concerts and thus widely detached from bourgeoisie, he finds out that he may make carrier by breaking out of this status-group isolation in trying to meddle with politics. He also finds out that for him, the best way is to put hand over hand along the rope that leads upwards while kicking the ones who are coming below him. The result is, however, that he blunders not only in public but often also in his private life. The film has an interesting, yet totalitarian and typical GDR-end which kind of disturbs the otherwise excellently crafted master-piece for which Werner Peters in the role of Dr. Hessling and the director of the film got the Great GDR-State Price.<br /><br />This movie and an extremely impressive list of some hundreds of titles more, meanwhile practically the collected works of the DEFA, the state film company of the former GDR or DDR, we owe to the Department of German Studies of the University of Massachusets at Amherst that has obviously taken over the legacy to maintain and foster the gigantic film work of the ""other"" Germany which has ceased to exist in 1990."
5320_0,"In the beginning, while watching this film, I was alternately disgusted and infuriated. I was looking at the characters thinking things like ""get a job"", ""say something"" or ""take a bath!"". Needless to say, I ended up being humbled and deeply moved. We glimpse each character's inner world, revealing their pain, faults and strength. And it literally turned the tables on me and got me to examine myself--my capacity for understanding and love. This is truly a great film."
5366_0,"What the devil is this? It's your typical TV-movie garbage... poor story (Not Verne's fault, it isn't even his original story but an adaptation randomly written by 12 monkeys) poor acting (who would have thought it, with Patrick Stewart and Kyle McLachlan's names being in it.) horrible lighting, horrible directing (And it's Highlander and The Shadow's Russel Mulcahy!!), unrealistic, fake and below-average TV-cgi. <br /><br />There's only one plus for this movie. If you are a Dune fan, you get to see again Paul Atreides and Gurney Halleck together again. But it's curious. It seems Stewart hasn't aged as much as Kyle has since the eighties. It's fun and nostalgic to see them together again. Unfortunately this nostalgia alone can't compensate for the silliness that reeks from every single scene. <br /><br />Patrick Stewart, as Nemo, is forced to wear a turban that doesn't really fit at all with his occidental complexion. He's also visibly embarrassed and stiff wearing it, and the result is not very convincing. You almost expect Stewart to say 'computer: end simulation' as Picard did every time he left the Holodeck in ST:TNG. It's too bad that the script was so lame because Nemo seems like the kind of character Stewart could have had a lot of fun with. Very similar to Ahab in many ways. A great man gone wrong. Unfortunately the script misses the mark, and he's displayed as a grumpy and slightly moronic host who couldn't find his shoes without his 'multipurpose butler'... a butler who doubles as cook, psychologist, physician---- I mean, this guy is incredible! <br /><br />Kyle's character is as alive as a chunk of wood. He's also inexplicably hostile towards Nemo without any good reason. He comes across as having horrible manners towards his host, no gratitude at all, and a recurring tendency to awkward reactions. There's a scene when he's dining with Nemo, in which there's a giant crab pincer served as main dish, and he seems completely oblivious to it. Only when Nemo warns him that the island is dangerous due to giant creatures, does he react with surprise and disbelief... well what's that in front of your face then you dummy???<br /><br />The rest of the characters are either cardboard cutouts or cannon fodder for the cheap CGI monster of the moment.<br /><br />Speaking of the monsters, one of the worst has got to be the giant rat, because in certain scenes instead of running, it almost looks like it's hovering over the grass. <br /><br />I won't even comment on the pirates, because they are uncomfortably childish.<br /><br />I'm a huge Patrick Stewart fan. I've seen some things I didn't necessarily enjoy just because of him being in them. but this is a true test of fan loyalty... Being in the X-men movies I wouldn't have thought he'd be that pressed for money. Because, as judging from my fellow reviewer's opinions, I agree 100% that he can't have thought this was decent material.<br /><br />My advice.. skip it. It's not even bad or pathetic in a good way. You won't have fun ripping it to shreds, because you'll probably be asleep or disturbed for most of it's duration."
5410_0,"This film is a complete crap that hasn't a single thing in favor. OK, maybe just one: It's Andie Tecec! I'm talking about the woman, not the actress. She's hot but as an actress she's as lame as any other thing in this movie! <br /><br />It's a completely ridiculous movie: tremendous stupid plot, bad characters, bad actors, hilariously bad screenplay and totally unfunny ""supposed to be funny"" moments. <br /><br />Now that I have finished watching it I just wonder why I didn't have looked at this movie's IMDb rate I guess it would have saved me one hour and half of a bad cinematic experience! <br /><br />Well, it's a complete 0 out of 10, but I've to score it 1/10, right??!!"
5456_0,"Awful short. It's about this gay high school kid who's attracted to a new kid in the school. The new kid is tall, smokes and is in good shape. The new kid invites him to his house (in the middle of nowhere) one night and thinks just turn dark and ugly.<br /><br />Seriously WHAT is this about? I have no problem with dark movies but a coherent plot would be nice too! The film is shot in a fragmented style that makes what little plot the film has hard to follow. It SEEMS to be saying something totally negative about being gay and being attracted to the wrong guy--that's all I could get out of it. It ends like a horror movie--a bad one. The acting is (I suppose) good--it's really hard to tell do to the awful dialogue and directing. A sick, disturbing and ultimately pointless short. Skip it."
5500_0,"One of the most unusual facets of the movie that struck me was the gowns/dresses designed for the lead actress--they stood out in this black and white movie making a not-so-tall Geraldine Fitzgerald look tall and elegant. Very few films have costume designs that out-do the performances--this film is one that achieves this unusual distinction.<br /><br />Equally unusual was the written prologue for the film on the statue. It wreaked of populist myths of the Orient and then ended with the statement that the film's location was London. One expected British mannerisms and accents and its distinctive transport--but the only reasons for the choice of the locations seemed to be the legal system, the law on Trusts, the pubs, the mention of Canada being far away, the South African mines, and the solicitor's office. The rest was distinctly American. Curious stuff.<br /><br />The film was equally curious for another factor: two women Icey and Janet look disturbingly similar, two men look considerably alike Mr Shackleford and Mr Fallon, save for their difference in height. Was there some reason for this or was this a coincidence.<br /><br />Apart from these details, the film provided much of the fare that ""The Maltese Falcon"" made cinema history--John Huston's screenplay and the enigmatic performances of Greenstreet and Lorre. Greenstreet did not have the brilliant lines of ""Falcon"" to aid him but his chortling performance is nevertheless fascinating. Lorre on the other hand provides the best performance because the grey cocktail of good and bad touches the viewer. Similarly the lead character of Fitzgerald leaves the viewer wondering whether the character deserves our sympathy or not.<br /><br />At the end, the viewer is forced to see ourselves in the mirror--we are but pawns of a mightier force, and none of us is either a villain or a saint. The film quite unwittingly makes the viewer think about life. That is probably why this film ought to rate better than ""The Maltese Falcon"" which no doubt has more catchy dialogues but less substance."
5546_0,"Just dreadful ""comedy"" about two young men who pretend to be gay to avoid being drafted.<br /><br />The comedy is horrible--very childish and stupid. The view of gays is simply unbearable--all limp-wristed, mincing, lisping men. Basically this film reinforces every single gay stereotype known to man. As a gay man I got so offended I had to stop watching half way through. It doesn't help that the print I saw had color that was so faded it looked like the film was in b&w.<br /><br />I suppose, in a way, this is useful in a historical context (i.e. to show how negatively gays were thought of in the late 60s). But its entertainment value is nil and it's so incredibly offensive it makes ""Boys in the Band"" look like an uplifting, liberating gay movie.<br /><br />For gay film completists only but be warned again...the view of gays here is deplorable."
5591_0,"I decided this fall season that I would give every show one chance. So far they've all been bust. But, last night I TiVO'd Reaper (thinking I wouldn't enjoy it at all) and to my much delighted surprise found myself really enjoying it. It has comedy throughout, action, drama, and could have some cool special effects down the line (if it gets picked up for a second season and has a bigger budget). I recommend people give this show a shot because it's a keeper this new Fall season. It has likable characters, a great story (whether you believe in the Devil or not), and it has all the elements to be a fantastic show. I hope America doesn't let this one slip by. And so far, this is the only new show on the CW I will be watching every week."
5636_0,"At first, I could not believe James Brolin was playing Clark Gable, but he is dead on with his portrayal!!! He's a great reason to see this film. I don't know why this film is rated so low. It was sweet, entertaining and the ending was heartbreaking. It was also great to see the implications of not being a ""moral"" and ""upstanding"" actor in the film industry during its early years. It shows how much times have changed. It was also fascinating to see if Clark Gable really had a softer side in him, since he was probably the greatest leading man in the history of Hollywood and a symbol of American manhood during his time. In my mind, this film is wonderful."
5681_0,"Another fine example of the accomplished French art of turning daily mundane situations into sheer genius entertainment. With the added bonus of being spoiled with one of Lambert Wilson's brilliant performances. Absolutely fantastic. Excellent script, splendid set, impeccable casting topped of with sublime camera work, lightening & soundtrack. A perfect mix of penchant humour, subtle drama & tantalising coincidences. Just plain top notch French cinema. An absolute masterpiece that qualifies as sin to miss out on. The best word to describe this movie is 'gezellig', a dutch word which unfortunately is notoriously renowned for it's inability to be translated into another language."
5726_0,"I saw this cartoon for the first time when I was under the age of ten, didn't know it was a ""movie spoof"" (which is mentioned in other sources)until I became an adult.

I haven't seen the cartoon in several years, but I find myself remembering it fondly! Love it! Love it! Love it! I was also surprised to find that one of the voices is done by a former child star who was part of the ""Our Gang/Li'l Rascals"" films. If you are a ""baby boomer"" like me and haven't seen this classic cartoon, you are truly missing a gem...another ""obscure"" music-related cartoon favorite: ""Russian Rhapsody"" (with ""Gremlins from the Kremlin"")"
5771_0,"Following the cult Brazilian TV series ""City of Men"" (2002-2005), Acerola (Douglas Silva) and Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha), two orphaned, teenage street kids living in Morro da Sinuca (one of Rio's 800+ favelas), are now about to turn eighteen and face the issues of adulthood. Fatherhood -- in a social milieu where most kids grow up fatherless -- is the key theme here: Acerola is now a teen dad who has to take care of his baby boy when his teen wife moves to São Paulo to work as a babysitter; and Laranjinha is on the search of the identity of his unknown father, only to discover he's alive and is an ex-convict on parole. On the background, the violent, destitute, lawless, drug-gang controlled life in Rio's favelas. <br /><br />A sort of mix of Fernando Meirelles' (co-producer here) ""City of God"" in visual style and ""Oliver Twist"" in spirit, one of the major problems of ""City of Men"" is its contrived plot solutions: we have to deal with Acerola's impossibly fast finding of Laranjinha's father whereabouts. And Acerola's grandmother ending up homeless and abandoned by her family (in the film's phoniest solution). And trafficker Nefasto suddenly changing sides in the gang war; and Acerola's one-chance-in-a-million spotting trafficker Fiel still alive, and the phony solution linking Acerola's and Laranjinha's fathers in the past, etc.<br /><br />Director Paulo Morelli -- who made the practically unseen ""Preço da Paz"" and the insipid ""Viva Voz"", and directed some episodes of the ""City of Men"" TV series -- comes from the publicity world, and it certainly shows. His images are (too) soigné: the black bodies have a golden shine, with pearly sweat drops and blazingly white teeth. He adopts cinéma-vérité style (in the camera-work, dialog, performances), now de rigueur in films dealing with ""stark realities"". Oscar-nominated editor Daniel Rezende (""City of God"", ""Motorcycle Diaries"") tries to keep things moving fast so we don't have time to think about plot holes and contrivances. Antonio Pinto's music is beautiful but inexplicably old-fashioned for a movie about teenagers. On a positive note, the sound design and effects are superb.<br /><br />The cast -- most of them from the TV series -- is asked to do more of the same. Douglas Silva (Acerola) relies on his intuitive acting and his big, expressive fish face. Jonathan Haagensen (as drug lord Madrugadão) again acts with his pout and bare torso in his usual laid back bad-boy style, looking suitably stoned. Babu Santana does his usual scenery-chewing in a bit as a trafficker. Camila Monteiro, Luciano Vidigal (a sensitive actor with an impossible part) and others repeat their TV roles. Eduardo BR as Nefasto suggests a blooming talent; Rodrigo dos Santos as Laranjinha's father has a great movie face, and first-timers Pedro Henrique (Caju) and Naíma Silva (Camila) are sensitively directed. The best is Darlan Cunha as Laranjinha: no-nonsense, nonplussed, witty and resourceful, his deadpan acting is the essence of the ""carioca cool"".<br /><br />But there's something bothersome about ""Cidade dos Homens"": it's hard to concentrate on Acerola's sex troubles or Laranjinha's unlikely instant attachment to his shady father (are Rio's street kids really this naive?) when characters like Caju (the dim-witted, glamor-seeking teenager who joins the drug gang) or those really original characters -- the teenage girls that have ""upgraded"" from ""gangsta molls"" to becoming gangstas themselves -- screamed for attention and development. The fact is it's weird to take ""City of Men"" for its face value, i.e. a buddy-buddy movie with the favela drug war on the background, though we all know ordinary life somehow always goes on even in the most violent, crude realities.<br /><br />By focusing on the personal problems of Acerola and Laranjinha, director Morelli and writer Elena Soárez (""House of Sand"", ""Eu Tu Eles"", lending a sensitive touch to what could have been a stolid buddy movie) choose to concentrate on plot and characters, using a lot of big close-ups of the kids' faces so we won't be distracted by the hellish favela background -- and yet the ""background"" jumps right on our laps. Poverty, segregation, racism, drugs, guns and violence, the absence of schools, hospitals, formal employment or government assistance, the dire conditions of life in the favelas that affect over one million people in Rio are, in fact, the cause of most of Acerola and Laranjinha's ""personal"" problems. Maybe one day we'll all be desensitized enough to take that sort of background as routine scenery, but not right yet.<br /><br />""City of Men"" has a major asset, anyhow: the final scene is lyrical, ingenious and filled with humor -- it's a great finale for the successful series that dared put on Brazilian TV favela teenagers as protagonists, teenagers who usually just show up in movies and TV (and, many times, and tragically, in real life) as traffickers, junkies, thieves or corpses."
5816_0,"I have to admit this film has a 'Have I met you before' feeling to it. But then most sequels do. Same characters, same personalities leads to some of the stuff being same-ish. Yet I ask you, how many people do you know that drastically change overnight? Not that many. So the same characters having the same reactions and habits to similar situations is not that far fetched. Hill Street Blues characters didn't change that much either yet it stayed entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The acting is of a very high quality and so are some of the action scenes. And there is a twist in the film I didn't see coming. So all in all, not a classic yet highly entertaining, and that is what it was supposed to do."

One thing I can say for sure is that this plot is simply unbelievable.<br /><br />I have seen the previous two installments of MVP, but this one by far is off the deep end. First, a chimp playing hockey. Yeah, I can see that. Then, a chimp skateboarding. A little less believable, but possible. But a chimp snowboarding? I think we're bordering on ridiculous now.<br /><br />I've worked with chimps, and certainly, they're intelligent enough to communicate in sign language, and convey their feelings. But snowboarding? What's next in MVP IV, a chimp that can cure cancer? I mean, come on. Let's not forget, that this animal will OFTEN throw its feces at anyone within 50 feet. Sure, I understand that they're trainable, and come off well on the big screen. But snowboarding? Why not have a lawyer show with MVP giving birth to a donkey? At least science makes that a possibility. This just isn't worth it, folks. Unless you'd like to build a stable in your backyard for your unicorns or ride a giraffe to work backwards, then don't watch this movie. It's pure fantasy. I mean, a chimp that snowboards? C'mon."

Paying homage to memorable classic such as; ""Somewhere in Time"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life,""it will easily be something that should find a home in your living room shelves.<br /><br />It emits a cinematic glow that hasn't been seen in years while cleverly conveying an educational message; <br /><br />""Never let go of the one you love, and cherish him/her always.""<br /><br />Don't let this sparkling gem pass you by..."

6086_0,"Though I know Schumacher is an established and good director, it's still hard to forgive him for practically ruining the Batman franchise. Town Creek is definitely a good redemption piece.<br /><br />I will admit, the first 40 minutes of the 90 total minutes had my head spinning at what this is all about. It didn't help that the original title was Blood Creek then changed to Town Creek. I definitely agreed with the ""blood"" part of the first name, but was/still am confused on the ""creek"" and ""town"" words. Sure, there's a creek involved, for all-but 56 seconds, but as far as I remember, there isn't much of a ""town;"" the overwhelming majority takes place on a farm.<br /><br />At any rate, the movie begins to unravel and it quickly becomes clear on what this movie's about. And, frankly, it's not that bad at all.<br /><br />The movie begins more than half a century ago with the Nazi's mission to locate the occult and its items of witchcraft located inWest Virginia, USA. (Really? Uh, okay, then.) An officer's willing to pay top dollar ($150! Fine, today would probably be over a thousand) weekly for the search on their land. They reluctantly agree and he finds what he's looking for quite quickly. The power (literally) goes to his head and, now, let's fast forward to the present Brothers reunite after one went missing for two years, and older brother, Victor (Purcell) leads his younger sibling, Evan (Cavill) to a sectioned off/private farmland to shoot up the inhabitants. Other than loyalty to his brother, paramedic Evan really shouldn't be involved in such cold-hearted murders, but, alas, he goes, attempts this and with his inner-conflicts, he botches a lot of Victor wants to achieve: the deaths of the entire family living on this farm. But, he's also looking for a ""him"" also living there.<br /><br />It's quickly apparent the family's equally afraid of the ""man"" living on their property, and once released from their makeshift prison, all literal hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Not too hard to place two and two together to discover both who the evil ""man"" is as it is the family living at the estate, but that's besides the many points/plot twists the movie brings up.<br /><br />It turns out the man can't enter the house where Evan, Victor and what's remaining of the family is hiding out due to symbols they've painted on the windows/doors. But, the ""man"" can kill mammals and send them in to get the blood he needs to ""advance to the next stage."" Quite frankly, I've given away a lot of the surprises in this feature, but I assure you, as I stop here in the plot synopsis section of my review, there's so much more to the storyline. As is there are other good qualities to the movie.<br /><br />Like I said, Schumacher is an established director; he knows how to build suspense, creativity and make a movie. This is a well crafted film and does have surprisingly good acting on all fronts. And though the plot (or I should say, the second portion of the movie) isn't the most original (SEE: Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight) it's still entertaining and recommended for horror buffs.<br /><br />Just do what I did, brave through the first 40 or so minutes and let the pieces fall into place and have fun."
6130_0,"This film is a compelling exploration of the complex relationship between the mother-daughter relationship and the rearing of young women under duress. Set in the context of a unique Girl Scout troop whose mothers are in prison, the film explores the problematic phenomenon of isolated families with creative force. Spiro is a talent cinematographer who gives the girl scouts their own voice by teaching them how to use the tools of production to document their own story. Some of the most touching scenes come from the young women interviewing their mothers about the realities of prison life. Few films of this nature avoid the exploitation that might arise from documenting the troubled lives of those who get little support or recognition in society. Spiro takes great care to negotiate the fine line between representation and serving the community being documented. In addition, the striking images of prison life juxtaposed with girls at play are a powerful reminder of the film's for problematic. This film is definitely a must see."

My childhood has coincided with our Reorganization and disintegration of the USSR and then at us information freedom, which was not in the USSR, has begun, and has appeared a lot of western, especially American, films, cartoon films, music. I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite ""Ninza Turtles"", and from ""ThunderCats"" I then saw only one episode (about huge spiders), but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they (ThunderCats) is my favorite cartoon serial from serious (and from comic - ""The Pink Panther"") and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original (without a translation into Russian)."

And he's either a very good actor, or a real weird person. I don't want to spoil the movie but glad the two boys find happiness. In fact I found myself thinking about the coffee scene and thinking of my boss. Over all a fun movie a lot different than I generally would rent but very glad I did. Has the redneck done any more movies, and what was his name. If anyone from the film reads this tell him he has a fan."

Great b/w vintage footage. Its like America's Funniest Home Video's for The New Yorker readers."
6356_0,"I bought ""Dracula Vs. Frankenstein"" on DVD under the Troma digitally remastered release of some of Al Adamson's ""classics"" (such as ""Satan's Sadists"" and ""The Blood of Ghastly Horror""). I'm somewhat of a fan of B-quality horror pictures if -- and only if -- they are entertaining (like Ed Wood's work). This one is pretty entertaining... but makes up for itself in way of how astonishingly brain-numbing the storyline is (or lack thereof). Inept? Yes. Continuity gaps galore? Yep. Uneven and absurd? Oh, yeah! I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years, so I can't do too good of a job explaining the storyline... then again, even if I saw it ten seconds ago, I don't think I could explain it. If you're thinking this movie is a battle of two great Universal Studio monsters, well... you're wrong. Dracula looks EXACTLY like Screech off of Saved by the Bell and Frankenstein looks like a hybrid mixture of a Cabbage Patch Doll and an actual farm cabbage.<br /><br />The epic battle of monsters isn't until the end of the film, which wasn't even worth the long, long wait. Simply put, the battle goes as follows: Dracula and Frankenstein are in the woods. Dracula easily pulls off Frankenstein's arms as if they were bolted on with Legos. Then, if memory serves me right, Dracula pulls off Frankenstein's head just as easily. Dracula realizes the sun is about to rise and he makes a fruity run to his castle... but before he can even make it to the door, he's fried by daylight right on his welcome mat! So, basically, the ending is a cinematic train wreck.<br /><br />The movie is amazingly uneven and often feels like a different sci-fi or horror movie every 10 minutes. The first 7/8 of the movie really isn't about anything other than a couple of people running away from Dracula and his magical death lighting bolt ring which lights people on fire... And there's some sort of weird-science thing at a Coney Island haunted house ride that involves a midget getting killed by an ax, some strange scientist and a couple naked women.<br /><br />I dunno... I don't get it.<br /><br />Funny movie, but I don't think anyone will really like it unless they're a fan of schlock.<br /><br />3/10"

6446_0,"There are many people out there who hate the way Paul Haggis made his directorial debut, ""Crash,"" an overly soapy and stupidly-tied-together drama (at least, that's what it felt like to them). Those people don't have to worry. His second major directorial outing, ""In the Valley of Elah,"" avoids both of the ""mistakes"" (although I'd hardly call them that, seeing as he won Best Picture for what he did with ""Crash"") that he made last time around. Instead of mixing together multiple stories and having them all connect at the very end, this movie revolves around one main story, a story that seems a lot like the modern-day war version of ""Chinatown."" Instead of going for simple emotional tugs that he did with ""Crash,"" this film focuses on its understated performances, namely from Tommy Lee Jones, who is superb in this film. It is truly courageous of Paul Haggis to be willing to make some serious changes to the style that won him a Best Picture Academy Award, and even more impressive that he pulls it off very well.<br /><br />The story revolves around an ex-military officer, Hank Deerfield, who is told that his son, a soldier returning home from Iraq, has gone missing. Jones plays the character in such a quiet way that makes you feel like he thinks he shouldn't be showing emotion, but has a lot of it bottled up inside of him. When he arrives at the military station, people don't seem to want to tell him what happened, and say that they expect he'll come to the base anytime soon (this is portrayed especially well by James Franco, who you may know as Harry Osbourne from the ""Spider-man"" movies).<br /><br />Refusing to believe that it's as simple as that, Deerfield is relentless in getting information out of people as to what really happened. It's the way he functioned in the army, and it benefits him greatly as he has to get any information he can out of people. Enter Detective Emily Sanders (played by a very strong Charlize Theron), who at first just wants to get through her job for the day, but soon gets wrapped up in also discovering what really happened to Deerfield's son. The two of them have great chemistry together, as their two different personalities give two different perspectives on what's happening.<br /><br />The movie works because although it does have quite a few negative things to say about the current war in Iraq, the entire film isn't a two-hour tirade against it. It only makes that message part of the story, and does it in subtle ways (aka the soldiers don't just go ""War...it...destroys...you..."" but take a lot more time expressing their emotion). Much of the story works like a mixture between the great film ""Chinatown"" and a much better-acted, better-written version of a really good episode of ""CSI."" Although there may be a few too many twists and lies circling about, it comes to its conclusion very well in a satisfying way for the audience.<br /><br />Paul Haggis has an uncanny way of bringing out great performances from all of his actors. The performance of Tommy Lee Jones could be the best of his career, he brings out a much more emotionally quiet side in Charlize Theron than we've before seen, the short performance of Susan Sarandon is particularly powerful, and all of the soldiers are played with a feeling of sincerity. The acting is probably the strongest element of the film, and if there's any ""weak part,"" it would have to be the way Haggis forced out some of the plot twists to make the film as long as he wanted it to be.<br /><br />Regardless of its few problems, ""In the Valley of Elah"" is both a very well-mannered look at the war in Iraq and its effects on the people involved, as well as a very interesting crime thriller. At the heart of it is Haggis's quietly powerful directing style and the cast's powerfully quiet performances. I don't see this picking up a Best Picture nomination as Haggis's past three Oscar hopeful screenplays (""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" ""Crash,"" and ""Million Dollar Baby""), but I would not be surprised to see it pick up a few acting nominations as well as possibly a screenplay nod. If it does...it would have definitely earned it."
6491_0,"Baseball is a great sport, but an horrible subject for movies. Except perhaps for EIGHT MEN OUT, or films where the sport is not the principal subject, like COBB, FIELDS OF DREAM, FEAR STRIKES OUT or BULL DURHAM, a comedy. Every time someone tries to make a serious film about baseball, it always fail. Billy Crystal offers us nothing original. His film is full of clichés : abusive slow motions (on the crucial moments, of course) stupid special effect when we see the ball coming right to us, horrible heavy orchestral muzak (on the crucial moments, of course). But the two young actors, Pepper & Jane, are doin' a very fine job. Also, Crystal offers us a good early sixties set. Hey! How about a movie about Barry Bonds breaking McGwire record ? And, in a few years, how about a film about Vladimir Guerrero breaking Bonds record ? I hope that some day Spike Lee will make his movie about Jackie Robinson. That will be the best serious baseball movie of all time."

6626_0,"First of all, the original ""The Prince & Me"" was good. This movie was just plain horrible. I agree with the original reviewer, this was not filmed in Denmark. The set (and I catch detail) looked like it was glued together. Just like it's awful sister ""Princess Diaries: The Royal Engagement"" (which was better) this was a bomb. Some awkward law stated a daughter, Kirsten (who appeared out of nowhere) is said to marry Edvard. Well blah blah blah, Paige (which if you turn her name from Morgan to Matthews, you got Paige from ""Charmed"") and oddly enough look kinda the same. Anyway, tabloid blah blah blah and girl rivalry and itching powder... Geez, can you get any more lame. Then after a little Harry Potter dungeon sitting, they find the loophole to this idiot-cratic (is that a word? LOL) marriage and voilà! They get married and live happily ever after... Did you ever have a doubt? Oh and BTW: Do not rent this on DVD, there is an error in the encoding that will not allow you to play the movie by pressing play. It's an Omen to let you know that this movie SUCKS!"
6671_0,"I live and work in LA. Here's the reason for my rating. First you take a random porn movie off the shelf, then you replace the physically attractive but creepy-brained human beings with the super ultra low rent versions of the same people. Only now they're large and less attractive, save one gravel-voiced sex cat, and they really truly believe they are making art. This causes every action and thought and move of the camera to s l o w w a y the f * * k d o w n. Then you take out most of the sex and replace it with documentary footage of, well, Mexico City.<br /><br />It creates a drugged-out kind of sensation watching it, by planting actors like stiff cardboard cutouts in scene after scene, usually staring into space amid saying a line or two like ""I just kidnapped a kid"" in subtitled slang. Then we're at a whore house to dangle the would-be sexual carrot for a bit, and it's back to staring at a fat dude in a cloud of farm dust. As though it's in the same metaphysical dimension as watching City of God or Capote... or Harry freaking Potter. It blows my mind that there isn't a 14 year old in Quebec with a digital video phone that hasn't put together a more compelling film to replace one like this in the indie theaters. Adults having sex and all. <br /><br />The true offense of Battle in Heaven isn't that it's a transparently disguised mindless self indulgence which only has common-thread relevance in a world that doesn't exist in reality (a 2006 world thirsting for high-art-concept low budget motion photographs of naked central casting hopefuls). It's not that you can see the actress' head tracking the camera and then relaxing when it landed on her, or the splicing of the edit in the bell ringing scene, or the totally scuzzy texture and manipulatively depressing guiding hand of the story and of its director. The real burr under my saddle was the potential I thought was there from watching the first scene, which seemed so erotic and new and animalistic and folksy and deeply visceral. It was arousing. Then, the movie seemed to relentlessly punish me, pummel me for hours and hours into a Latin America submission. The movie made me embarrassed to have been turned on at the beginning. More than that, it made me feel a little repulsed even at the thought of sex. When I got home I told actually told my pet parrot that a piece of me had just died. That hormonal piece that gets excited at the gates of Heaven even though what awaits me is just another Battle. Watching this film aged me. I grew up more than I wanted to today. It was icky.<br /><br />I'm normally one to shun mean spirited criticism of other people's art, but obviously this is where I draw the line. These filmmakers deserve many things, but participation in Hollywood isn't one of them. I should know, I was in Gigli."
6716_0,"It's been a while since I acquired a headache from a movie. For that, I thank ""Bee Movie,"" a dreadfully mindless excursion into the worlds of both copycat kiddie fantasy and shameless commercial promotion (for a show that's been off the air for years).<br /><br />This was a movie I never even wanted to watch. So the disc was inserted without my blessing into a DVD player that should be praised for its patience at showing such garbage, and I was subjected to all 90 or whatever minutes of this trash festival. I was told I wouldn't even notice the nasal, whiny, someone-please-strike-him-mute voice of hack comedian Jerry Seinfeld (that's right, I said it, Seinfeld *and* his show are two of the most cruel things that can be unleashed upon mankind). Naturally, that was wrong.<br /><br />Basically, that meant that the movie was basically a rehash of movies like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz,"" both of which were very good movies in which insects dreamed of a better life and had the fortitude to make it happen. That sentence should be its own genre by now! Even the actors I had genuine respect for (Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, and Larry Miller, the hilarious voice of the pointy-haired boss in ""Dilbert"") were unimaginably uninspiring. They had absolutely no shame, wasting what seemed like hours on jokes about rock star Sting. They even sank so low as to feature a character called ""Bee Larry King."" Next time, can we please get Dugong Dr. Phil a role in a ""Madagascar"" sequel?<br /><br />When a bee stings, it dies. It's a fact of biology. And this putrid bug corpse starts stinging the moment the disc drawer is closed."
6761_0,"When you're not expecting much, it doesn't take a masterpiece to impress you. I watched The Sex Monster knowing that it had a bisexual-relevant theme, but uncertain of whether it would be a positive or negative portrayal of bisexuality and sexual experimentation in general. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Mike Binder somehow managed to take all of the tired stereotypes about gender and sexuality, weave them into exaggerated characters, put the characters in awkward situations, and make it all uproariously hilarious. Some viewers, no doubt, will interpret the caricatured portrayals as perpetuating outmoded stereotypes and perhaps even contributing to those stereotypes. But Binder's wit is both subtle and blatant: the dialogue makes use of every cliche imaginable, yet is still fresh and funny.<br /><br />If you're cheek is prepared to accommodate your tongue, definitely see this movie (rent it! and then buy it to show all your friends). Be warned, though, that what you assume about people may be forever changed."
6806_0,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Josh Randell (Norris) is in charge of a security at the casino owned by his adopted Jewish father and his wayward son, collecting small debts and taking care of trouble-makers at the casino. But now he faces a new threat in the shape of Romandy (Peter Cavanaugh) a small time gangster's son who wants to take over the casino. When the family refuse to hand it over, Romady turns nasty and Randell is left to take his adopted sister and his lover on a wild journey across the mean streets of Hong Kong in a desperate struggle to stay one step ahead of danger.<br /><br />In the very early 80s, a little while before Schwarzenegger/Stallone and a good while before Seagal/Van Damme, Chuck Norris enjoyed a period where he was pretty much the number one name in action movies. But they stuck to a pretty repetitive formula and one movie was pretty interchangeable from the other. This would be one such movie, only, as other reviewers have noted, with an even more wooden performance from the lead star. But there's some good kung fu action on display, an appropriately drawn theme tune and a pretty neat revenge theme running through it, so it's one of his better ones. ***"
6851_0,"Sure Ice-T is cool and Michael Madsen is cool in strange way and Eric Roberts has a cool sister. Unfortunately she wasn't in ""The Alternate"". I've seen thousands of films and this has got to be the baddest yet, not bad in the good sense, just plain bad. The ""action"" scenes were among the poorest I've EVER seen, or Eric is just plain good at dodging the several million rounds fired at him. His Glock should be investigated as it held in the neighborhood of 100+ rounds between reloads, perhaps that's why he couldn't hit anything-the thing was too heavy from all the bullets. The director, who's name I choose to forget and I hope Hollywood does likewise, should be given one more chance, to direct a kindergarten play in Spudville, Idaho. I will admit that Eric's use of the action verb ""GAACK"" several times was one of the thrilling moments of the film, perhaps the apex."
6897_0,"This delightful documentary, directed by Patrick Creadon, is a dream come true for people that enjoy to solve crossword puzzles. It centers around Will Shortz, the current New York Times editor, who has revolutionized the way we do the puzzles today. The film was co-written by Christine O'Malley, who with the director, takes us to meet some of the people behind the scenes.<br /><br />We must make a confession from the start, we are one of those addicted to solving the daily crosswords in the paper. The New York Times puzzles are the best of all the ones published by any newspaper. Of course, we are not in the league of the likes of Tyler Hinman, Trip Payne, or Al Sanders, who were the three finalist in the 2005 competition, but we are happy with just the idea of solving them every morning.<br /><br />There are many personalities that speak about their addiction to the crosswords of the New York Times. Among them, we hear from former President Bill Clinton, a man that has always been notorious for his quick mind. David Okrent, the former public editor of the Times, makes a surprise appearance. Jon Stewart is also funny in the way he deals with clues and how he blames Will Shortz when he doesn't get them. Mike Mussina, The Indigo Girls, Bob Dole, and other celebrities also are seen.<br /><br />The great fun of ""Wordplay"" is watching a master constructor of the stature of Merl Reagle creating a daily crossword right in front of the camera, and explaining the logic behind it. There is a funny moment when Ellen Ripstein, a former winner, tells us that in spite of having won, she keeps going every year to participate in the tournament. Her performance in the entertainment part of the competition brings a light and goofy moment to the film.<br /><br />The only thing we don't get too much of is the master himself. Will Shortz appears all too briefly as the emphasis of the documentary seems to be the annual competition at the Marriott in Stamford. Some of Mr. Shortz observations are funny, especially when he shares his typical weekly correspondence from frustrated people that are ""puzzled"" by his clues.<br /><br />""Wordplay"" is a film that will resonate more with crossword puzzle lovers, but it is a fun movie to sit through because the witty material and the pace it was given by its creators."
6941_0,"Yuck. What a terrible movie. I really can't phathom how combining a great actor like Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking, the Game), a good actor like John Travolta (Pulp Fiction) and an ok actress like Robin Wright Penn (Forrest Gump) can result in a monstrosity like this. The Penns play Maureen and Eddie with absolutely NO charm, with as result that the first half of the movie is almost unbearable. Travolta at least seems to try after that, but the sheer stupidity of the story is too large an obstacle for even him to overcome. Conclusion: a real waste of time, money and talent."
6987_0,"The elaborate, carefully planned comedy - even in the opening credits, in which nothing moves - must have been maddeningly difficult to shoot. It's a pity Jeunet and Caro sought to top their efforts when they made ""The City of Lost Children"" five years later. The result was lifeless and over-elaborate; here, the level of elaboration is just right, with no sequence allowed to be more complicated than it is clever. And even the most gratuitous fantasia - like the montage with the creaking bedsprings, the ceiling repair, the cellist and the metronome, the knitting, the drilling, and the bicycle pump - grows naturally out of the story, like a flower on a vine.<br /><br />But the biggest surprise to someone expecting another ""City of Lost Children"" is how real the sentiment is. Both films are populated chiefly by grotesques; the difference with the earlier one is that we're allowed to see the human beings underneath, without being invited to laugh ironically. It's worth noting that in the later film all finer human feelings were given to the mentally deficient - a retarded loner, a complete madman, and a child - as if sanity and intelligence precluded the possibility of any other admirable trait. But in ""Delicatessen"", Louison, however naïve he may be, is no fool; the enchanting Juliet, even as she fumbles her way through a disastrous date because she feel embarrassed wearing glasses, is no object of ridicule. Nobody, in fact, is completely an object of ridicule. Even the butcher is allowed a moment or two when he is neither a joke nor a threat but a human being, one who finds he regrets the life he now leads but is not persuaded to abandon it.<br /><br />Even if ""Delicatessen"" had been recommended to me I doubt I'd have seen it in its original release. The fact that it was being praised as black comedy would have scared me off. It is indeed black comedy, but I urge you not to be scared: there's nothing nasty about the taste, and the dominant tone is one of optimism. We don't know the nature of the calamity that has struck this world. (It's not, as some people have mistakenly thought, anything so mundane or so easily comprehensible as nuclear war.) We don't know if the plants will ever grow back. But there's so much genuine hope it's hard to believe they won't."

Liam Neeson was completely believable as a hillbilly,and the train jumping scene was fun to watch. The flophouse he was staying at is EXACTLY where someone like that would end up. And I must say, that Patrick Swayze added a nice visual interest. Is a shame that his real life wife didn't recieve credit for playing the violin.

7076_0,"Who knew that material so vile, obscene, and disgusting could be presented so beautifully? Visitor Q is a movie that goes too far, but carries itself wonderfully so that it is able to go the full distance without losing its audience. Visitor Q deals with a lot of risky subjects, including incest, necrophilia, rape, abuse on women, heroin addiction, and a slew of other things that would usually be used to describe fetish pornography.<br /><br />First things first, this movie should not be mentioned in the same vein as other movies that ""go to far."" This is not your blood and guts (and rape) horror slasher fest. Visitor Q is an emotional, powerful movie that rivals even the most well constructed Academy Award winners. Also, do not get the idea that this is another Eraserhead or Izo or other ""strange"" movies that it may get compared to. Though Visitor Q is presented in a strange manner, it works well with the odd subject material and Miike is subtle enough in his direction that the viewer will not be confused by the end of the movie.<br /><br />For Takashi Miike fans this is the epitome of all of his work (only rivaled by Audition). Miike's style really shines through and his ability to be shocking, yet appropriate, is very clear. Miike uses excellent imagery and deep characters that will make you go through many emotions. You will laugh, you will be disgusted, you may be offended, and by the end you may be so overwhelmed that you may cry. The last shot of the movie is so beautiful and so fitting. There are very few movies that wrap it up so perfectly in the last frame and Visitor Q happens to be one of them.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful. Everyone plays their part to near perfection. Shungiku Uchida, who plays the mother, is especially great. Her turn towards the end of the movie is felt. Kazushi Watanabe, who plays the visitor, is also great in his mostly quiet role. His silent presence worked very appropriate in enhancing every other character.<br /><br />Visitor Q is not a confusing movie in any manner. Just a very strange one. It is different. Visitor Q introduces you to a dysfunctional family and you find yourself getting put right into the middle of it. The characters embark on huge emotional journeys that eventually lead up to what is one of the happiest endings in any movie that does not get sappy. Visitor Q has everything you need in a great movie."

7166_0,"It's not worth going on too long about this semi-supernatural thriller. The young, cute, predatory-looking blond Izabella Miko attends the funeral of her erstwhile best friend at a remote New England estate ruled by Miko's ex lover, Austin Nichols as Roderick Usher.<br /><br />The two of them are rather gloomy. I mean, what with the suicide of the best friend and all. The atmosphere isn't helped by the presence of the housekeeper, Beth Grant, made up like a vampire, so much so that Madonna would look like a fresh-faced virgin beside her.<br /><br />The general air of dread doesn't keep Miko from spending a lot of time wandering about the mansion in her underwear. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that. I do it all the time myself. The problem is that these scenes are the highlights of the film! This is worse than Edgar Allan Poe's worst hang over. The photography is atmospheric enough and the location aptly chosen but everything else seems slapped together. It resembles a carefully conceived feature film the way a child's rolled-together limbs and torso made of clay, topped by a tiny ball of a head, resembles a human being.<br /><br />Nobody in it can act, but -- that aside -- the story itself makes no sense. Edgar wouldn't have cared too much about that, but he had other things going for him, whereas this has only Miko's buns. Of the three principles, Miko is least bad, Nichols is well into negative territory, and Grant's every utterance reminds us that she's trying to act in a movie.<br /><br />At first, after doing her grief work, Miko comes on the Nichols, smooching him up, her wide-open lips revealing glistening incisors of frightening dimensions. He demurs. His neurasthenia prevents him from responding. Later, when she arranges matters less formally and straddles his lap, he apologies because he still can't perform. There is another murky scene in which she toys with the belt of his robe. Next thing -- pow! -- she's pregnant with twins. What is this, coitus interruptus without the coitus? The least the director could do is throw us an explicit and climactic scene of strenuous coupling.<br /><br />""Neurasthenia,"" the mysterious disease from which Roderick Usher suffers, is an old-fashioned term, current enough in Freud's period of disorganized nomenclature. It was used to refer to what we might call chronic fatigue today, combined with a little attention-getting irritability.<br /><br />But why am I going on about neurasthenia, you ask? Because I think I caught it from this movie. I notice it particularly in regard to my black cat, Pluto, a fiend from hell. I keep telling him, ""Just keep it up, that's all."" But does he listen?"
7210_0,"Taking aside when it's edited down for its content and for time, this is really a neat movie to watch when it comes on TV, which- if you have cable- is pretty often. It's also one of the best vehicles for Joe Pesci that was ever made (even if it didn't technically originate with him), and will probably make for part of his great standing as an actor years later through all the other Scorsese movies. It's sometimes very ridiculous- i.e. the suit Vinny wears to Court following no choice, always brilliant- but it's also got a sincerity to it that works. It's original in its characters and dialog even if it always takes some liberties with Southern and New York clichés. The best example of the former would be with the grits part in the courtroom scenes (""no respectable Southerner would make instant grits""). And the cast surrounding Pesci always makes it worth watching. Marisa Tomei- maybe a little unnecessary of an Oscar win- is in her prim here as Vinny's girlfriend-would-be-fiancé who ends up helping him out more than he could've thought. Meanwhile four of the more talented character actors, some seen more than others, bring up the courtroom scenes perfectly- Fred Gwynne as the judge, (the late) Lane Smith as the prosecutor, Bruce McGill as the Sheriff, and Austin Pendleton as a stand-in defense attorney. They bring both professionalism and a few laughs in measure with the very sharp, unpredictable script. That it also sometimes leaves it onto Pesci's shoulders to keep up entertainment wise is not altogether unexpected. But at the end of it all it's a very watchable, endearing piece of work, where the case itself in the story is not as worthwhile as the memorable lines of dialog or the bit players. And there's even a bit of good craftsmanship that goes unnoticed by some in it as well (the first scene at the bar shows this if you look close enough). Whether you've seen it in the theaters or not, it's probably one of the true enjoyable movies to watch on a weekend afternoon with nothing to do."
7256_0,"The family of Anna DelaMesa come from bourgeois backgrounds. It is then, surprising, the path both decided to follow politically. The father, Fernando, a Spaniard, had lived in France as an exile for many years, never returning to visit his own family in Spain. The mother, Marie, is the daughter of wealthy parents who live in some splendor in a rural part of France.<br /><br />When we first see them, they are celebrating the wedding of Isabelle. Fernando, a brooding man, has recently been joined by his sister Marga and her own kid, Pilar, something they did to avoid being taken into custody by the Franco regime. Marie and Fernando agree in letting them stay with them for a while, something that Anna doesn't appreciate since her cousin only speaks Spanish. <br /><br />Anna, who attends a catholic school in Paris, taught by nuns, sees the world around her from a grown up point of view. She can't say much about what she perceives, yet a lot of things affect her. Take her parents' involvement with the leftist Chilean regime of Salvador Allende. Fernando and Marie have been instrumental in his election, having even left the children behind in France to work for the cause. Anna, is a highly sensitive girl whose life is deeply affected by the way her parents act toward her and Francois, her younger brother. To make matters worse, Anna is told to stay away from religion classes at her school. She becomes the center of attraction as the other girls can't grasp why is Anna different, something that she tries to cope with, but to her young mind, is never solved. <br /><br />Julie Gavras, the daughter of famous director Costa Gavras, tried her hand at directing before. This is her second try behind the camera. We have not read the novel which served as the basis of the film, which is misleading, since one expects to refer to a Cuban situation, when in reality, the DelaMesas work to help the regime of Chile's former president Allende.<br /><br />Ms. Gavras must be congratulated for the work she got from child actress Nina Kervel-Bey, a girl of maybe seven years who does an amazing performance, and through whom all the action revolves. Others in the film, Stefano Accorsi, who has been working in France lately, plays the father of Anna. Also notable, Julie Depardieu, daughter of Gerard and Elisabeth, in the role of Marie.<br /><br />Although the film is based on an Italian novel, one wonders how much is autobiographical, given Ms. Gavra's own background. Maybe she was meant to be the right person to bring the story to the screen."
7300_0,"If IMDb ever needed a ZERO category for a film, this is it. Voting ONE is to heap unwarranted praise on this trite and pretentious effort. The silver wasted in the emulsion would have gone to far better use in dental fillings. Oh, it undoubtedly was a hit at the Toronto Film Festival as the beautiful people oohed and aahed at its daring innovation and creative groundbreaking. Yeah. Right. Acceptable words fail me. Would the BRAVO channel have shown this were it not required to meet Canadian content regulations? Would it even have been made if its perpetrators had not been able to feed at the public trough. We do some things very well in this odd country of ours. Making movies is not one of them!"
7346_0,"Scifi action film about a cop investigating murders tied to the death of his partner. All roads lead to a weird institute where weird experiments involving memory are taking place.<br /><br />Its a been there and done that sort of a film, especially if you watch any number of dystopian scifi films. What strikes me as kind of sad was that the film often feels like its standing in front of you waving at you in a pathetic attempt to make you think you haven't seen this before. The film's case cover mentions that the action sequences were from the person responsible for the action in the Bourne films, and that maybe the case but the director doesn't shoot it with any sense of Bourne's style and the result is further boredom.<br /><br />Not worth your time."
7391_0,"I saw this movie at the Riverside Film Festival and was shocked to find out it has not been released nationwide because it was not picked up by the big studios for distribution. They (the Hollywood types) are so out of touch as far as knowing what the average movie-goer is looking for - they made a big mistake passing on this movie. It's a wonderful film and had a little of everything (with the exception of graphic violence and sex!)- action, suspense, romance, intrigue, etc. I found myself laughing, crying, cheering, clapping, and enjoying the roller-coaster ride of emotions to the very end. It's definitely a must-see for every age group."
7436_0,"I like films about killers, especially those with an interesting little story or something that makes them a bit different. The Alphabet Killer doesn't disappoint in this respect. <br /><br />I'll admit, the start was pretty poor, I felt it was quite disjointed and it seemed as though a lot of scenes that should have been there to develop the plot were on the cutting-room floor. However, once we get into the middle and latter stages of the film, we definitely see a marked improvement.<br /><br />I think Eliza Dushku played her role well in this, and I felt the slant of Megan's mental illness playing such a large part in the story made her character more believable, and added interest to the film.<br /><br />Overall, this was a nicely put together film. It had little gore or anything really adult-themed, so if that's what you're after this isn't for you. If you want a killer movie portrayed more through the eyes of the main detective than is usual, you might like this. Yeah, you'll probably suss it out, but that's half the fun."
7481_0,"SPOILERS WITHIN!!!<br /><br />Working as a second shift engineer at a PBS station has it's compensations... and the WNET production of Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN is one of them!<br /><br />The night that we aired it I didn't get a whole lot of other work done; it grabbed me from start to finish, and I stayed married to my console and program monitors all the way through.<br /><br />This version has more guts than the 1940s movie version in that it's much more true to Wilder's original intent. This version doesn't ""chicken out"" on the ending and spare Emily's life. I always considered the Hollywood ending to be an unforgivable act of cowardice.<br /><br />I've seen the play many times before, but this production startled me in it's final act with a single bit of stagecraft.<br /><br />The sequence featuring Emily's funeral... mourners singing around the grave. Emily's sudden appearance as she leaves the world of the living is unexpected, and ELECTRIFYING! It's the slickest handling of this part that I've ever seen, anywhere!!!<br /><br />The following sequence with her as the new arrival to the graveyard, and her attempts to relive the best day of her life are BEAUTIFULLY handled. The performances are absolutely riveting.<br /><br />I'd STRONGLY recommend this performance for introducing teenagers to the dramatic stage... if it's possible to get use rights, it would make an EXCELLENT classroom teaching tool, especially that amazing final act.<br /><br />If you get the chance to see this performance DO SO!!!"
7526_0,"In 1984 I was more active in going to Duffy Square in Manhattan and seeing what plays I could get tickets to on Broadway. One that I saw was YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, which (as I had seen productions of it in the past) I was acquainted with. I decided to see it again because this production had gotten good reviews, and it starred Jason Robarts, with Ellis Rabb and Colleen Dewhurst in the cast. Actually while it was exciting to see a play with Robarts and Dewhurst in it the latter had a small cameo role and only appeared in the final act (where she did a comic bit about dancing with Rabb). But watching Robarts (the only time I saw him on stage) was wonderful. I was so close to him that I could see his character (Grandfather Martin Vanderhof) perusing his ""stamp collection"" (the small collection book actually did have stamps in it!). <br /><br />It is fortunate that a video record of the production still exists, complete with performances by Robarts, Dewhurst, Nicholas Surovy, Bill McCutcheon (as Mr. DePinna), Jack Dodson, and others of the original cast. Only Raab was not in it - ironically his role of Boris Kolenkhov the Russian dance master is played by George Rose, who I also saw on stage in other plays. But Rose was a fine comic performer and gave proper distinction to the Russian's famous put-down (""It stinks"", said with a friendly dismissive air).<br /><br />The story by Kaufman and Hart is about the eccentricities of the Vanderhof - Sycamore clan, which does not pay taxes (why should it? taxes are only used to support the Navy, and the last time it was of use was in 1898!), which gives free room and board to several people like DiPinna and Kolenkhov, and which encourages freedom (Penelope writes stories because a typewriter was once delivered to the house by mistake, her daughter paints DiPinna as a discuss thrower, her husband makes illegal firecrackers in the basement,and her son-in-law earns his living with his small printing press (unfortunately printing Communist posters). When her more staid daughter falls for a normal boy, and the family of the boy is invited over, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />The movie version of the play (directed by Frank Capra) expanded the philosophy of enjoying life into another assault on the super-rich, with Edward Arnold as Mr. Kirby...not as a stockbroker as he is in the play or in this video production, but as a banker and empire builder, who gets emotionally twisted and lost, and then finds himself again. While certainly an interesting variant on the original play it was unnecessary. The original has a lot of nuttiness and common sense mingled into it, and is one of the few comedies of the 1930s that are still capable of revival. The production here keeps the single stage production of the Broadway revival (which is possibly a mistake - they could have shown say the basement of the house). On the other hand the single set keeps the record of the original revival production in tact. I can only say it is worth watching."
7571_0,"OK first its soft-core porn, if you don't like a lot of soft lesbian scenes you may as well go elsewhere. As far as porn rip offs of well known films go this isn't bad. The characters are easy enough to laugh at, Erin Brown (Aka Misty Mundae) is hysterical as the main character and her wizard mentor Smirnof will have you in stitches. The plot is of course a very simplified version of the Tolkien books with as many sex based jokes as they could cram into one script. The effects are cheap and so are the costumes but you won't care. The actors know they are making a cheap parody and they run with it playing it for laughs all the way. There are several times they break the fourth wall but if it worked for Groucho it can work for this film. Grab a beer or 6 and some pretzels, but try not to drink to fast or you may end up doing spit takes while watching this."
7616_0,"Miriam Hopkins finds herself in love with both Gary Cooper and Fredric March (who can blame her?), so she does what any sensible Pre-Code woman would do: she decides to live with both of them!<br /><br />It's a tribute to movie audiences of the early 1930s that a sophisticated comedy like Design for Living could a.) Get produced, and b.) Be a success at the box office. The dumbing down of current films means that the delicious innuendo in Design for Living would go over the head of most of today's audience.<br /><br />The key to the Lubitsch Touch was in the perfect timing of physical gestures and the delivery of the lines. Trouble in Paradise and Design for Living were the best in this respect. Personally, I prefer the lack of music in Design for Living. I think it dates the film less than Lubitsch's other efforts.<br /><br />I don't mind that Ben Hecht wrote most of the film's dialog rather than Noel Coward, who wrote the original play. All I know is that the dialog is very very funny and quite naughty, making this the ultimate Pre-Code film.<br /><br />Miriam Hopkins could do no wrong in a Lubitsch film, and her work here is brilliant. She's intelligent and uncompromisingly honest. Her leading men, Gary Cooper and Fredric March, are both sexy and hilarious. Gary Cooper is a particular revelation, displaying a flair for comedy that is quite unexpected. As Cooper's friend and rival for the affection of Hopkins, March is also very funny, which comes as no surprise after his brilliant parody of John Barrymore in The Royal Family of Broadway (1930).<br /><br />Prepare to laugh yourself silly during what may be the funniest film ever made."

Commando Norman Hopper(John Saxon)rescues a couple of Vietnam POWs who contracted a rare disease that compels them to consume human flesh. One of the soldiers, Charlie Bukowski(John Morghen)bites Hopper in the rescue. War hero Hopper will be plagued with cannibal instincts fighting their way to the surface. Bukowski escapes from a veteran's psychiatric hospital and immediately goes into relapse and a gory rampage begins. A gun battle with police will comprise the meat (no pun intended)of the movie. An overload of ridiculous profanity doesn't succeed in shocking anyone...just laughable. Special effects are just as hilarious. Also in the cast: Elizabeth Turner, Wallace Wilkinson, Tony King and May Heatherly."
7706_0,"Very impressive cast in a better than OK murder mystery. With touches of All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard, this film moves along at a good clip with only a few draggy scenes.<br /><br />Ginger Rogers plays a bitchy stage diva who is married to a mousy man (Reginald Gardiner) and lives in the same apartment building as her producer (Van Heflin) who is also married to an actress (Gene Tierney). While Tierney is away, Heflin attends one of Rogers' big parties and meets a quiet young woman (Peggy Ann Garner) who actually has no real interest in acting or theatre. She is a writer. He invites her out for a real meal and she insinuates herself into his life.<br /><br />The party scene is pretty funny with Ginger ripping off several ""Margo Channing"" ripostes at the expense of Bea Benaderet. Heflin is infatuated with the serious young Garner whose only link to the stage is her uncle (Otto Kruger) who is an actor. She also befriends a young brother and sister from Boston (Virginia Leith & Skip Homeier) who are doing the Greenwicj Village beatnik thing.<br /><br />Well there is an apparent suicide and that brings in a detective (George Raft) who hounds everyone. When the suicide is discovered to be a murder, things get really dicey for all involved.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is solid. I never liked Heflin but he's OK in this film. Rogers plays the diva well and looks great. Tierney gets a few good scenes. Raft is solid as the detective. Gardiner is especially good, but Peggy Ann Garner, a top child star of the 40s is quite excellent as the moody and strange young writer. Oddly, she didn't make a film after this one for another 12 years. She reminds me here of Barbara Bel Geddes. Bea Benaderet as the party guest, Otto Kruger as the uncle, and Leith and Homeier as the beatniks are all good.<br /><br />Also in this film are Cathleen Nesbitt oddly cast as a cleaning lady, Mabel Albertson is the bar owner, Hilda Simms plays the sympathetic waitress, and believe it or not, the gangly witness from the movie theater is Aaron Spelling, who would have a major career as a TV producer.<br /><br />Worth a watch."

7797_0,"Certainly, quite early on in his career, Jimmy Lydon was ""trapped"" in the Henry Aldrich series and while ""Life With Father"" may have been his most prestigious film, ""Strange Illusion"" gave him his best role.<br /><br />Paul Csrtwright (Jimmy Lydon) is troubled by recurring nightmares in which his dead father warns him about a stranger's evil intentions about his family. He is staying with his teacher Dr. Vincent (Regis Toomey) but feels he must go home at once to protect his mother and his sister. When he arrives home he finds his mother, Virginia (Sally Eilers) has been seeing a lot of Brett Curtis (Warren William) - a man who Paul feels uneasy about at first sight. His sister Dorothy has a great crush on him but Brett is a sinister villain with a weakness for young girls.<br /><br />Paul's dream starts to come true, Dorothy receives a bracelet from Curtis, he hears a very loud concerto and then faints. He decides to investigate Curtis, with the help of the family servant, Ben (George Reed), who has never liked Curtis. Before he died, Paul's father started to investigate a shocking unsolved crime involving the drowning of a wealthy young widow. Paul has a right to be worried, Brett has a grudge against Cartwright, whose meddling stopped his plans years before - he now wants revenge. Brett's first plan is to convince Virginia to marry him and then to have Paul committed to a sanatorium. Meanwhile Paul's friend Lydia confesses that she has had a confrontation with Brett at her family pool and has always felt uncomfortable around him. Paul is keen to go to the hospital - he thinks he will find out something there as Brett is very close with the head doctor.<br /><br />This was a really good movie with the dream sequences a bit of a twist on the tired old ""why won't anyone believe me"" style plot. Warren William made these type of roles his own - the icy exterior hiding deep feelings (in this case murderous). Sally Eilers looked lovely as the mother, caught in the middle of a suave conman and her son's concern. Both of these fine actors left the screen in the next couple of years. Again, it is a movie I would recommend."

I completely disagree with some of the reviews here about the acting, the reviews at Amazon.com where I bought the DVD were really good.<br /><br />I like this sort of film, it's easy viewing, not difficult to follow, the writing is very simplistic but the characters were throughly entertaining. Surprisingly I thought Gerard was one of the weaker performers compared to his usual standard.<br /><br />Well worth watching if you enjoy all round light entertainment."
7887_0,"Great performances by Madeline Kahn and Edie Falco, as well as the rest of the cast push this fine independent movie. The story revolves around one day on Long Island in the lives of a half dozen or so people, connected by various relationships (family, school, work). From the depressed would-be filmmaker to the talentless, but ever hopeful, aspiring actress the movie finds a way to take you deep inside the characters without really letting you know much about their lives beyond this single day. The eclipse at the heart of the story allows for some great lighting effects on the black & white film."
7931_0,"Caribbean Mystery is a good book by Agatha Christie, but I wouldn't go to say it was one of her best. It is worth the read, but I do prefer Murder is Announced and Sleeping Murder out of the Marple books. This adaptation while taking some liberties with the book, is the best adaptation, and yes I do prefer it over the Helen Hayes version. The adaptation is beautifully shot, with lovely camera work and the scenery is colourful and very pleasing to the eye. The music is well composed and fits nicely with what's going on on screen, if careful not to overshadow the action in those crucial scenes. The script and plot are solid, while taking liberties with the book. Speaking of the changes, I liked the idea of Miss Marple visiting the chambermaid's aunt, however some other changes like the dead coming back from the dead seemed far-fetched and didn't quite work. The adaptation also is rather lengthy, and there is some sluggish pacing in the middle half. On the plus side though, asides from how it was filmed and the good plot and script, we are also treated to a first-rate cast. Joan Hickson is as wonderful as ever as Miss Marple, and Donald Pleasance makes the most out of his role as Jason Rafiel. Sue Lloyd is suitably nasty as Lucy Dyson, and T.P.McKenna is good as Dr Grahame. Adrian Lukis and Sophie Ward are a little on the dull side as the Kendalls though. I will say the final solution was very effective. Overall, a worthwhile diversion, not so bad as an adaptation either. If you want a better Hickson- Marple adaptation though, try Murder Is Announced and Sleeping Murder. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

8156_0,"Firstly, Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic. Remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you know what's coming and because older films relied much more on acting as opposed to present day films which tend to rely on special effects, violence and sex.<br /><br />That aside, this film was overall a fairly enjoyable film to watch. My one major complaint for this one is that it wrapped up too quickly. By the time we have this guy getting accused of killing people, he's shoving the mother's head into the door and coming to the main character's house and slamming people's heads in with a bat.<br /><br />I think the film could really have been improved by letting the suspicions and tensions run a little longer. It seemed like we found out that he really was the killer too soon.<br /><br />Otherwise, I thought this was a fun film to watch mixed with some funny moments. It's worth watching."

The dialogue alone kept me interested throughout the picture so I never found myself suffering through a section of the movie to get to ""the good part"" Given the genre and the title of this film Im not expecting material deserving of an Academy Award.

8246_0,"First off: Larry Raspberry? He's the ""star"" of this odd little picture and while his bio says he was in the Gentrys back in the 60's I seem to remember an album called ""Larry Raspberry & the High Steppers"" or something to that effect. Anyway, there's another Raspberry in this movie too, his brother, I'd guess. I imagine they got razzed in school about that. ANYWAY on to the movie: This takes place supposedly in the 50's or early 60's, and it seems to waver between when it wants to be as it talks about seeing Invasion of the Body Snatchers and then mentions a roomful of people as looking like the casting room for 'Psycho'. 50's or early 60's stock footage is interwoven with the actual film to give it a more authentic look, I reckon, and it usually works, except for the modern hairstyles and the distinctly non-period soundtrack. We have two escaped convicts, space aliens, and two rival Cola companies that all come together to make zombies out of the people of Pleasantville. I didn't know where this was filmed until the end and it's in Tennessee, I could tell it was somewhere in the south because of the obvious accents. Overall this is an interesting little movie and yes, even somewhat strange, but it's nothing terribly astounding. The look and the atmosphere is good, but trying to follow what's going on is a bit tough. I'd say this was fairly fun if you watch it in the spirit in which it was made, but don't expect a work of cinematic genius. 7 out of 10."
8291_0,"This is a good little movie that heavily relies on its uneasy atmosphere. The movie is also greatly carried by its cast, both the adult as the children's.<br /><br />The story is simple yet effective. The story perfectly sets up an uneasy atmosphere that is dark and sober. The story is unusual and original as well. The movie can perhaps be best described as a dark drama/thriller. The fact that the movie is both unusual and original is probably the reason why this movie unfortunately isn't any better known.<br /><br />The character are perfectly portrayed in the movie and play a great role in the movie its story. The movie is especially carried by the children cast of the movie, who play the most significant and biggest role in the entire movie. The young characters are all both realistic as powerful. Every characters has its own strong personality and they are what make this movie always interesting and never boring to follow, even though the pace itself isn't always terribly high.<br /><br />But the movie also has a good adult cast that unfortunately is perhaps a bit underused at times. Dirk Bogarde plays a great role in the movie but unfortunately his character is introduced at least 15 minutes too late in to the movie. Once his character is introduced in to the story the movie takes more form and becomes even more intriguing to follow. It was also great to see Yootha Joyce in the movie, who I only knew from the British comedy series ""George and Mildred"". She is a great actress and really gets to show her skills in this movie. <br /><br />The movie handles some intriguing, original and uneasy themes and the movie handles all those themes on its own very special way.

The boy plays in his closet with a He-Man-like action figure, and a odd statuette he calls ""Deceptor."" His father hears a strange moan, makes an odd phone call to his research partner, and goes upstairs to the boy's room with a machete.

The detective befriends the boy, and the shrink helps him on the case.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty uneven. The death scenes are fairly good. A pale grinning figure in the closet is pretty spooky. Dead people who reappear as zombies or as a demon appearing like them are pretty well done. The demon exerts its power by psychically dragging someone up a wall, and across a ceiling towards an out-of-control ceiling fan. The demon itself is pretty darn lame, however."

8471_0,"Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" is one of his far-less loved films, and even Spielberg admitted he was disappointed with the final result. This is quite understandable: ""Hook"" begins as a great movie, but ends only as a good one. I looked forward to it: Robin Williams, my favourite actor, in a Steven Spielberg (my favourite director) film? Bring it on, said I! Let's throw clichés out the window for once. This is essentially a movie geared towards kids, so clichés are rightfully ignored. The movie asks the question: What if Peter Pan grew up? This has never been done before, and this is why the movie stands out: it isn't afraid to explore the unexplored.<br /><br />Robin Williams is perfectly cast as ""Peter Banning"" (who we all know, of course, is the grown-up Peter Pan). Bob Hoskins is positively brilliant as Mr. Smee, Captain Hook's right-hand man. He provides a lot of comic relief, which is fun to watch. Dustin Hoffman himself is a great Captain Hook. Hook is not a purely evil villain in this film, though. He is a comic villain, funny in a goofy kind of way (proof that ""Hook"" is aimed towards the kiddies more than anything). But Tinker Bell is poorly played by Julia Roberts, who played the character with an attitude, and unenthusiastically, and you can easily tell.<br /><br />The first, say, 25 minutes of ""Hook"" are brilliant: Williams is a workaholic who has no time for his kids, when they are kidnapped by the villainous Cap'n Hook. Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) tries convincing him he is Peter Pan, and later that night, he is visited by Tinker Bell, who takes him to Neverland. This is when the movie stops being amazing, and becomes just ""good"".<br /><br />For once, I found a reason to criticize Spielberg's direction. He made a horrible directing choice when showing the first (non-bird's-eye view)shot of Neverland. I was expecting a breathtaking, sweeping, panoramic first view of Neverland (which is lush and green in my imagination). Instead, there was a confused muddle of an establishing shot. People, buildings, and ships are cluttered so close together, Neverland is revealed for what it is: nothing more than a movie set on a sound-stage.<br /><br />Another criticism I have is about The Lost Boys: none of them are very good actors at all. (This is not to say they're terrible, but they're quite amateurish.) And one of them is alarmingly obese, so much so that later on in the film, his body doubles as a boulder for bowling pirates over.<br /><br />And finally, the fight sequences are poorly choreographed, and the fencing is dull, nothing more than shuffle-thrust-shuffle-thrust, over and over again. Williams and Hoffman may be smashing actors, but they are probably poor fencers, to have their routines limited to such simple moves.<br /><br />One more thought: as with nearly every Spielberg movie, John Williams composed the music for ""Hook"". I'm a big fan of Williams' work, and looking back on the movie, his score was the absolutely brilliant highlight of the film. If you're going to watch Hook for anything, watch it for the music. Williams integrates his music marvellously with what is going on, and the music itself is beautiful: melodic, fun to listen to, and pleasing. His opulent and recurring theme for Captain Hook is one of those tunes that get stuck in your head and refuse to leavebut not in a bad way.<br /><br />In general, ""Hook"" is entertaining. However, it is one of Spielberg's more flawed movies. So why the 10/10? Maybe because this is a film that I truly enjoyed, even though its flaws stuck out a mile when I started writing the review. After all, what's wrong with a little dumb fun now and then?"
8516_0,"That's a very convincing point you made. So let me get this straight, you didn't say wow, it was great for adults and teenagers (so they've killed their chances at the toddler and senior citizen market?), it was above average but failed at being a really good movie, BUT kept you on the edge of your seat. Very concise and to the point, good job. I'm definitely gonna go and probably see this movie or another one.<br /><br />Traitor was very edge of your seat thriller. The movie just doesn't really ever make you say wow. The whole movie was the SAME from beginning to end. It was just mostly bombings. The story was way to confusing and was jumping all over. Despite that the movie was ABOVE AVERAGE. If the movie wasn't so confusing and boring it would have been great. This movie had so much potential to be a good movie but failed. This was a GREAT MOVIE for adults to see though. I think most teenagers wouldn't enjoy it as much. So I do recommend this movie to adults. The acting was very good and Don Cheadle didn't fail once. He was great and really was a blast to watch in this movie. Overall though the movie was alright with very good acting. Go see it if you like thrillers."
8561_0,"It makes me sad that, with such great actors to work with, the best the Coens could do is make a mish-mash comedy/drama/horror that was lukewarm at best and boring at its worst. I felt sorry for the actors; they had so little of interest to say or do. I almost fell asleep about 20 minutes in. Where was the madcap screwball comedy? Where was the dark ironic humor? It was all just one-dimensional darkness. Where was the good editing? (i.e. we never saw Clooney holding the gun but we know he shot Pitt in the closet.) Instead we get pointless, morose and dull. This movie coulda been a contender. These characthers coulda been somebody. Instead they're really just forgettable. And that's just a waste."
8606_0,"It's movies like these that make me wonder what insane people would be shameless enough to put their names on this piece of trash. Spoiler: There is a ridiculous dance scene that made tears come to my eyes as I was laughing at the dork flailing around to a boy band. Dialouge= terrible. Little girl= annoying. Dad= stereotypical. Watch it for the laughs, not for the quality. There are some good Disney movies out there, this is not one of them!!! There is also a scene where the entire family must defend there lives in an exaggerated smoothie malfunction scene. Parents, this is one movie that you probably don't need to watch with your kids."
8651_0,"It seems like most (if not all) the movies I can remember watching with Meryl Streep in the lead are at least solid movies. This one is no exception. Although the pacing trickles at time I always was interested in the characters. Streep, Cher, and Russell are all pretty good. Fred Ward and Craig T Nelson also lend some good support to the leads. There are quite a few supporting actors who have made their niche over the years and are recognizable. Based on a true, Silkwood is deliberate and methodical; at times feeling cozy. The set (house) of the main characters serves as a great backdrop for their bantering dialog. It's set in the south around Oaklahoma and Texas. Only small problem was the ending seemed a little bit hastily put together though, a little bit detracting. Nevertheless worth at least one sit down viewing."
8697_0,"The quintessential Mike Hammer (Robert Bray), haggard, menacing, but essentially a decent guy in a dirty world inhabited by ruthless killers, gets involved in the murder of a young aspiring actress, who only the night before he had met at a lonely downtown diner, and had helped out with bus fare back to her native Nebraska. Her death was related to a piece of jewelry she was carrying, part of a cache of stolen war time jewels. Forced to get to the bottom of the murder, not for money but because of his connection to the girl, he unravels the mystery in the typical Hammer fashion of payoffs and beatings. Released two years after Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, MGiQ is the poorer man's version, though it has its own charms, mostly in the way of the LA settings and Bray's portrayal, tired and unshaven, but with the determination of a pit bull."
8741_0,"Boisterous and funny, Buddies is (yet another) widescreen spectacular of larrikin behaviour set in outback Australia. Looking like MAD MAX or Sunday TOO FAR AWAY and in mining territory, this is a blokey comedy with excellent leading pals (Colin Friels and Harold Hopkins). However, like most films released in 1983, it died the death of a brown dog at the box office. Nobody went to the cinemas in Australia in this period as the video boom took away all but the very biggest of releases. So many good films crashed and burned in 83/84. I have never seen it on video, or TVand a DVD release would be good looking for all the intended original reasons. On a big cinema screen it works well and looks great. It is dusty outback buffoonery and well made. If you have seen SIAM SUNSET or PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT you might get an idea of how well BUDDIES looks in cinemascope. Same territory and equally as enjoyable."
8787_0,"Probably the only movie ever made about a terrorist hunting super-model, James Toback's thriller is not particularly good. It's a snail-paced film featuring Nastassia Kinski as a model recruited by Rudolf Nureyev to kill Harvey Keitel. Kinski is pretty good and looks striking and Nureyev is suitably mysterious. Unfortunately Toback's script suffers from a real case of inertia, the plot doesn't so much unfold as it oozes. Kinski's character is fuzzy and Keitel, who shows up near the end of the film, is really given nothing to do. There is some terrific, very moody photography by Henri Decaë and the film does work as a travelogue of sort of the more seedy parts of Paris. Toback makes an un-billed appearance as Kinski's brusque college professor. Pierre Clémenti plays one of his typically creepy roles as one of Keitel's less trustworthy confidants."
8831_0,"When I wrote about this show for the first time, I did it after the pilot episode. But after 7 episodes, I feel myself able to truly say something about it.<br /><br />As I said for the first time, Candace Bushnell knows a lot about women and New York and that's why she has a lot to tell. Sex And The City was about the searching for the true love and not about power, and Lipstick Jungle is about power and the search of a truly self that's hidden somewhere, and it's an interesting plot. What I feel after 7 episodes is that for sure is an interesting plot, but the show is getting a lot late to make it interesting.<br /><br />The show focuses the lives of 3 friends placed between the 50 most powerful women in the world. All of them has well designed personalities but none that we haven't seen before as the insecure and family troubled Wendy (Brook Shields), a movie producer that despite her insecureness she makes right decisions in her work but it's kind hard for her to tie work and family; the self confident but unhappy Nico (Kim Raver), a magazine editor who is moved by challenges and is tired to be ignored by a husband that never gives her the attention she deserves; and the lovely and believer Victory Ford, a fashion designer that wants to conquer the world in her own impulsive and sentimental ways and is dealing for the first time with the downs of her career.<br /><br />The cast is quite good but it's kinda hard to feel a great chemistry between them when they're all together but that's OK because most part of the time the story sets each one of them individually. Brook Shields is good even if sometimes she looks like playing ""Suddenly Susan"" again, but her character is always surrounded by a lot of happenings being hard to follow all the issues at the same time. Lindsay Price is a lot unfamiliar to me because she's been in countless shows but I can't remember her in any of them, anyway, she surprises me a lot when I got myself laughing with some of her moments, but her character stills being quite weak to be placed as ""one of the 50 most powerful women"" in the show. Kim Raver is by far the best choice because she's proving to be one of the best TV actresses of the time, she's always a lot convincing and her character is for sure the best edged of the show, her previous works with strong characters like Kathlyn Hale in ""The Nine"", or Audrey Raines in ""24"" and Kim Zambrano in ""Third Watch"" gave her great bases for the confidence and the dramatic lines that Nico needs and Lipstick Jungle is being all about her and she deserves this attention after so many supporting roles.<br /><br />The show lacks of some prime attentions and qualities that made Sex And The City a great thing. New York is being a lot secondary in the plot and that's a shame because this city is a living character for Bushnell's stories. The characters still not being interesting enough (except Nico for the reasons above), and the male characters are being very unnecessary than it should. The plot is flowing in slow motion and after so wrong twists seems like the writers are finally getting in their shape after hard 7 episodes. Now I can see that some really interesting things are trying to come and the show is finally and slowly getting its way. A lot of changes has been made from its pilot, but the show screams for further important turns with urgency.<br /><br />It's a nice show, and it's being hard to forget it because, as I said, looks like it's finally getting its right tone, and if it does and they kick it right, it promises to be not as fabulous as Sex And The City, but admirable."
8877_0,"This film holds up well as a good, basic thriller. It doesn't have the same kind of strange, mystical power of other Lewton films, but is effective at invoking the image of dark streets at night, when the most ordinary sidewalks and street lamps take on a sinister feeling. The most remarkable aspect is the surprisingly strong and unconcealed sexual motive for the killings. SPOILERS AHEAD: The murderer's confession at the end is reminiscent of the speech Peter Lorre makes to the kangaroo court in Lang's M. His compulsive, rambling confession has a strangely authentic quality, of the words spilling out awkwardly and spontaneously, trying to make sense of his crimes as much to himself, as well as justifying his actions to others. Though a blatantly sexual motive isn't mentioned, it's hard to interpret his words any other way, except as a twisted, rape sort of feeling. The photography is excellent and the performances at least adequate. Two sequences are especially effective, the young woman trapped in the locked cemetery, and the terrifying encounter of another girl with the escaped panther under a railroad bridge. This last sequence still has the power to unnerve the viewer sixty years later, and is one of the best of the Lewton ""buses"". This may seem petty, but at least two other viewers have commented on the same theme. The mean-spirited mother who refuses to pay any attention to her daughter's story of the escaped panther, and dismisses it as a lie to get out of going to the store, and then cruelly locks her out of the house, must be the most obnoxious mother outside of Cinderella. The younger brother mocks his sister's fear, by throwing the shadow puppet silhouette of a leopard's head on the wall of the kitchen, but is seen doing the same thing in the funeral parlor, where his sister is lying in her coffin. Whether this was intentional, or the child actor felt like doing it and didn't know the camera was on him, I don't know, but I found myself yelling at the DVD player, "" That a..hole is still doing it! What the hell's the matter with you?"" No one in the movie even seems to notice."
8921_0,"This movie ended up being a lot more than I expected. I thought it was going to be another one of those zombie movies with three snobby girls and the one good looking jock, but it's far from that. One of the main things that puts this movie ahead in my opinion is that to me it's more about the people and the government's reaction more than anything else. The characters are normal people, living normal lives, and you really begin to like all of them. It's filmed in such a way that you start to feel like you're right in the midst of the terror, right next to them, and you can't take your eyes away. And the 'creatures.' They're terrifying. The idea of rat creatures at first doesn't seem that scary, but they do SO well with these. I'll never have a pet rat again, that's for sure. All in all, this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It is absolutely terrifying, and it really makes you think."
8967_0,"The racehorse in A GIRL IN EVERY PORT isn't the only thing that's lame. The plot, scripting, pacing and every other facet of this film follow suit. Even the title is misleading, as the ship never sails anywhere, and the only girl involved to any great extent is a stunningly moronic Marie Wilson. This film proves that labored, unfunny ""comedies"" were being produced long before the current spate of mindless garbage began spewing from our television and movie screens. The characters in this film all appear to have IQ's somewhere in the single digit range. It is indeed sad to see so many talented actors tangled up in this unfortunate yawner. Avoid this film at every opportunity."
9010_0,"Some reviewers seem to think this movie was not sufficiently faithful the book. Personally, I could care less. (And I'll happily say the same about film versions of books that are near and dear to my heart.) You want the book, go ahead and read the book. THIS City of Ember happens to be a movie. A really entertaining movie, that works amazingly well on its own terms. (And made me want to read the book, which you'd have to agree is a good thing.)<br /><br />Other reviewers seem to think this movie ripped off the game Fallout, or the movie Dark City. Well, I'm afraid you are WAY out of touch with culture. This movie 'rips off' endless previous works. The first one I thought of was Arthur C Clarke's haunting novel Against the Fall of Night. Then I thought of the game Bioshock. Then Robert Heinlein's novel Orphans of the Sky. Then George Lucas' film THX-1138. Then a rather under-appreciated book by British SF writer James White, The Watch Below. And THEN I thought of Dark City...<br /><br />None of those parallels bothered me at all. Why should they? I can't recall anyone disliking Bioshock as a ""rip off"" of Against the Fall of Night. The theme of people trying to escape from a 'lost' city is classic, well worth revisiting periodically.<br /><br />And this movie does it really well, bringing a number of unique strengths. I very much liked the two kids that are the heroes of this story. I liked all the small characters, especially Martin Landau as the over-the-hill maintenance man. I LOVED Bill Murray as the villainous mayor. He should play bad guys more often. And above all, I really enjoyed the visualization of a 200-year-old city where all the technology has been failing for generations.<br /><br />No, the story held no surprises. So what? Tell me you didn't know from the start how Die Hard was going to come out. Or Raiders of the Lost Ark. Or The Guns of Navarone. Or, in fact, ANY 'genre' movie. When the destination is known, it's the journey that's important. And I really enjoyed every minute of this journey, from start to finish.<br /><br />City of Ember (the movie) is well-written, well-acted and visually beautiful. It's got a rousing story, quite a few laughs and a really great (if well-worn) premise. That's more than enough for me."
9056_0,"I recently saw this film with Quentin Tarantino's introduction to this film on video tape from Trio. Quentin goes on about how Mel Brooks lifted a good chunk of the premise of this movie for Silent Movie. While the basic idea is the same, down on their luck film makers try to sign big stars for their up coming film, the results are decidedly different. Brooks played it pretty much as a straight film, while Olsen and Johnson used it as an excuse to do silly things with famous people. I prefer the pure insanity of Olsen and Johnson's take.<br /><br />This is one of the best films that Olsen and Johnson ever made, even if it has one really big problem (which I'll get to in a minute). This is pure Olsen and Johnson insanity. Its a film where anything can happen, usually the silliest of all possible options. Its wild and wacky with Olsen and Johnson acting as steam rollers over Hollywood and the studio system. When the comedy is happening its a rapid fire collection of jokes and gags that never seem to stop.<br /><br />Or rather stop a bit too often. The one really big problem I was talking about is that the comedy and the madness stops every couple of minutes for a musical interlude. These interludes pretty much stop the movie dead since any of the momentum thats been built up comes crashing to a halt. Most of the numbers are played straight so its a radical shift in tone that really annoyed the heck out of me. (Actually the numbers aren't bad they just belong in a different film) I know that the numbers are the result of this being one of those ""studio"" films where everyone in the studio appears partly as part of the story, but also as an advertisement for themselves and what ever movie they are currently promoting. (Hollywood turned these out every now and again often to mixed results) <br /><br />Music aside I really like this movie. If you want to see Olsen and Johnson in great form this is a good choice to make."
9100_0,"""Lust, Caution"" is a picture of the power of tremendous forces on that which is ultimately unable to bear the strain: a picture of a tidal wave crushing victims, or of a hurricane ripping through buildings.<br /><br />There have been many reviews of how this movie suffers in intrigue, and lacks in the typical Hollywood excitement and fireworks. *This is not simply a spy flick!* These reviewers might also observe a natural disaster and comment on how the buildings were all poorly constructed and the victims too weak to provide sufficient excitement and entertainment.<br /><br />Tang Wei, Ang Lee & co have put together a brilliant depiction of a dark and haunting time when the common person was buffeted and often destroyed by the struggle between titanic powers, emotions, and ideas.<br /><br />Tang Wei as Wang Jiazhi stands out especially as a perfect victim for the emotional and psychological blows that she suffers from the beginning to her last moments on camera. Floundering in the maelstrom of the time, Wang Jiazhi fights valiantly to grasp at something, anything to justify her existence. The sacrifices she makes and trials she endures become a dark and painful comedy of errors that will be even more poignant for those who can understand her predicament and the times Wang Jiazhi lives in. Each time, Wang convinces herself to plunge headlong into her endeavors:<br /><br />********spoilers start***********<br /><br />1. She sacrifices safety for the chance at love, achieving only a passing admiration and infatuation. 2. She discards innocence (with the worst possible candidate) for a patriotic cause, gaining only a bloody consolation for a lost prize. 3. She sells her inheritance for a chance to study, only to be forced to learn something she despises. 4. She suffers the unspeakable for a chance to complete a mission, only to be drawn in by the enemy. 5. Coming full circle, she compromises the mission for the hope of love and safety, throwing away life and the respect of friends in one fell moment.<br /><br />*********Spoilers end**************<br /><br />The failures of Wang Jiazhi pursuits are shocking to point of comedy at times, just as one might gasp and laugh coldly in near disbelief at extreme tragedy and carnage. However, Wang Jiazhi's story is one that would only be all too common in that day and age.<br /><br />While the NC-17++ scenes do contribute to the raw and poignant artistry of the the movie, the storyline and acting is enrapturing in and of itself. The sophisticated and empathic audience is sure to find this film a winner that will haunt their thoughts long after more foolish viewers have lost interest."
9146_0,"This was a well-done Walt Disney animated movie. Although not a huge fan of the movie, I find no fault at all with this film, and it's especially appealing now that it's out on DVD. It looks and sounds super. The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.<br /><br />The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little ""teacup"" is the cutest of the characters.<br /><br />The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies."
9191_0,"I sat down tonight and watched this film, after a full week of re-watching the Beatles Anthology, I was really excited to see this film because it's suppose to be so hard to find, well let me tell you I was so disappointed I can't even begin. The truth is this film is to the Beatles what ""Eat the Document"" is to Bob Dylan. It's interesting but it's also boring and pointless. They don't explain anything, if I hadn't watched the Anthology Doc I wouldn't even have a clue why the hell they're in this big film studio, plus, I don't think John Lennon says more then three words in the whole film (Paul never seem to shut up though). It's more footage of them singing and playing the songs then anything else. I'm sure for some people that's going to be really fascinating, but for me I can listen to the CD, I want to hear them talk, argue, get into it, tell a joke something, but no they just sort of sit around and don't do anything. The only part of this film that I really really liked was the footage of ""I Me Mine"" where John and Yoko waltz around the empty sound stage. More of that kind of stuff would have made for an interesting film, but instead it's all music and not much else. If someone that really, and I mean really loves the Beatles said hey should I watch that film, I'd say have you seen the Anthology, if they say yes I'd say don't bother, because most of the good stuff is on that anyway and it's properly formatted. If you really must go ahead and watch this film but be warned if you're looking for anything other then a series of them playing various songs, forget about this one."
9236_0,This movie is a great representation of how nihilism is often confused with anarchism. People like to confuse the two of them and consider them to be the same. The Anarchist Cookbook demonstrates the differences between the two of them and manifests the ideals between two of the main characters: Puck and Johnny Black. Puck represents anarchy which can be nihilistic but does not have to be as it is often unstable. Puck is a fantastic representation of anarchist ideals used in good and bad ways from when he works with johnny to when he is working sixty hours a week and throwing surprise birthday parties for his co-workers. One of the biggest things he does is when he kills johnny black and all the skinheads that were working with him. The reason that this was so significant was that he was showing the distinction between governmental law abiding and vigilante good deeds. While murder is not a typical good deed he showed that there is clearly a grey area to kill a few to save many. In the end he was no better off than he had been but had learned and incredible amount from his experiences.
9281_0,"It amazes me, that Valentino-as-the-sheik was able to start such a fashion in the 1920s. Watching this sequel of THE SHEIK I keep seeing everything that had already been recycled in the Broadway operetta DESERT SONG - also filmed as an early talkie, shortly after SONG OF THE SHEIK. Valentino far outclasses everyone I've ever seen play ""The Red Shadow"" - and visually the SON OF THE SHEIK is much better than any DESERT SONG film version (even the later, color one). Considering the intense interest in 'Arab Matters' today, it's sad that no one revives DESERT SONG done Valentino-style. Because even after all those years - his 'hypnotic gaze' in the film remains hypnotic."
9326_0,"I just saw this movie last night. I bought it for 3 euros on DVD so you can't go wrong there. The reason I bought it is simple: I like movies about sharks and there are only a few about the Meg(alodon). Too few, but I heard that Jan de Bont wants to film the book Meg (great book) so lets hope that will happen. About this film: You get what you expect: A cheap-looking, low-budget (horror?)film. It takes about 45 minutes before we get to see the shark, so until then the viewer is bored with mediocre acting, simple character- and story building and cheap SE. The thing that bothered me the most were the computer generated effects. I hate that sooooo much and this whole movie comes from the computer: The snow, the helicopter, the oil rig and the shark. I understand that the budget was low but a computer isn't the solution. The other thing was that there were only a few actors in the movie: Should I believe that a handful of people operate a huge oil platform? Yeah right! The movie is about a shark, but the shark isn't convincing either. It looks good standing stil, but the way it moves, swims attacks etc etc isn't very good. And the climax...You almost have to see it to believe: It left me with unbelief...so dumb and simple.<br /><br />It's a short movie (1 hr 12) minutes, the sound was horrible (DTS!), full screen, but what killed the movie were the computer effects....so not worth your time or money."
9371_0,"It was nice reading the reviews for this film as so many people picked up the real elements of this movie and not just about the horror.<br /><br />This movie, as most great movies, is a subtle love story, where someone realises they are a burden and maybe even a danger to them, and so make the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Cronenberg is probably my favourite director as he is able to take unusual film idea and turn it into something intense and believable. As he has evolved he has improved his writing and as a results the stories have become more hidden and more intelligent.<br /><br />I think the Fly, Deadzone and Videodrome are his best work. His more recent films, Crash and the Naked Lunch have impressed me with his ambition and ability to try something new, but have failed as entertainment. <br /><br />I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does, even with very obscure subjects, but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again. <br /><br />Highly recommend  9/10"
9416_0,"When searching and looking up movies on the IMDb I'll often come across movies and think to myself that 'this one should be a little bit higher,' or 'that one should be a little bit lower' -- generally speaking I'm pretty comfortable with the ratings that I see. Every now and then though I find a rating that just absolutely mystifies me. Did the people who voted watch the same movie that I did? The number is an extreme from where I think the film actually belongs. For me, Val Lewton's 'Isle of the Dead' is one of those films. It currently has a rating of 6.4 and when I saw that I was stunned to say the very least.<br /><br />I first saw this movie on late night BBC (I was living in England at the time) a couple of years ago. It has stayed with me ever since. I love old movies and horror movies are one of the kinds of film that I actively seek out and watch. 'Isle of the Dead' had a lot of competition if it wanted to have any lasting impact with me. It left a great impression and is the reason that years later I've sought out the rest of Val Lewton's work. 'Isle of the Dead' remains my favourite and I truly hope that people will give it another look.<br /><br />Let me start with the setting. When I originally watched it I thought it was so fresh and original to set a horror film during the Balkan's war in 1912. I can't think of any other films that have done that before or since. You get a very morbid opening scene that reveals a great deal about Karloff's character. He doesn't instruct a sub-ordinate to commit suicide, but he publicly humiliates them and pushes a revolver towards them after making it quite clear that their military career is over. He has an extreme sense of duty, justice and obligation. Fail, in his eyes, and you'll pay a deep price. He's also very protective in his nature -- especially of the men who he commands. He is modern in his approach. Reason and logic are his weapons but superstition and a sense of obligation are his foundation. This is the man who will be trapped and quarantined on an island with a group of travellers and strangers while a plague, or something more sinister, slowly kills each of them off.<br /><br />The movie is extremely claustrophobic and very well done. They can see the mainland but can't go to it. They are trapped in their own rooms -- alone -- or in the house with the other quarantees. The doctor will try to save them. Science, reason and logic -- the General's core -- will protect them. But when that core begins to fail, he is influenced by superstition, folklore and hysteria ... and acts accordingly. It is a terrific part for Karloff and the General is a great character study. The psychological depth is wonderful. There MUST be a rational explanation for the deaths. They try, and fail, to fight plague-like symptoms by using plague preventative techniques. He is so wedded to finding rational solutions that when confronted with their failure, paradoxically, he decides that the rational solution must be supernatural agents at work.<br /><br />'Willing Suspension of Disbelief,' seems to be an unfamiliar concept for some of the film's naysayers. The film is unbelievable because people from different countries appear to be able to converse -- without difficulty -- in one language. It is in Greece and the only non-Greek characters are a British diplomat and his wife (may we presume that being a diplomat to Greece, knowledge of how to speak it MIGHT be advantageous?) an American reporter covering the war and a Greek general (since he doesn't have an interpreter, MIGHT he not have some knowledge of the language?), an ex-pat archaeologist who has been there for over a decade (he's probably had NO opportunity to pick up ANY of the language then, eh?) and a travelling student who is eager to return home (that classical education of Greek likely being of no use to him). People don't like the costuming either -- Karloff's wig being such a distraction that it makes the film unenjoyable for them. I really have no way of responding to what seems like an infinitesimally small and nit-picky criticism. The core of the story is whether or not as a horror film and a character study it successfully builds tension and depth from beginning to end. Do consequences of actions have meaning? The tension is high from the opening scene and the stakes only get higher through the film until the final bloody conclusion. The scares are fantastic -- particularly one in the shadows and who comes out of them. There is a tremendous scene with a coffin that is the very height of anxiety, despair and cinematic tension. Is that scene predictable? OF COURSE it is! That's what makes it's eventual occurrence so intense! It is a huge pay-off that is advertised with great skill and execution. This is one of the best films that Mark Robson ever directed and I think he graduated to A-list director largely because of it.<br /><br />'Isle of the Dead' is under-watched, under-rated, and a gem of cinema intense in it's own beauty. It might be my favourite horror film of the 1940's through 50's."
9461_0,"From what I can gather, two main social factors led to the popularity of the gangster genre in the 1930s. The first, and most obvious, was the prevalence of criminals like Al Capone and John Dillinger, who were glorified by the national media. The second was the Great Depression, and how it impacted the traditional notion of the ""American dream."" Families  regardless of character or social standing  were torn apart amid the economic collapse, and no doubt many ordinary citizens contemplated crime as the route to happiness.<br /><br />Films like 'Manhattan Melodrama (1934)' and 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938)' place great emphasis on the thin line between ""good"" and ""bad"" characters, and often the central criminals are lamented as victims of circumstance. For example, James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan and Pat O'Brien's virtuous priest were separated by a matter of metres when the former is condemned to a life of crime. Circumstance, too, drives the fates of the characters in 'Manhattan Melodrama.' As children, both Jim Wade (William Powell) and Blackie Gallagher (Clark Gable) lose their parents in the burning of the steamship SS General Slocum, a true-life disaster caused by gross negligence that cost over 1000 lives. Each child responds to this injustice in their own way: Blackie rebels against the judicial system that betrayed him, whereas Jim enters law in a bid to reform it.<br /><br />Whereas Warner Bros. was responsible for most of the decade's gangster films, 'Manhattan Melodrama' was produced by M-G-M, and helmed by W.S. Van Dyke (director of the first four 'Thin Man' films), whose decidedly non-gritty aesthetic style at first seems at odds with the required mood. However, it would be misleading to compare the film with the likes of 'Little Caesar (1931)' and 'Scarface (1932).' Firstly, Hollywood was now working, for the first time, under the active supervision of the Production Code Administration. Also, the studio's intentions for the film were undoubtedly geared towards a higher-brow audience, further suggested by the unintimidating, woman-friendly title.<br /><br />Gable's ""Blackie"" Gallagher is not a paranoid hot-head like Tony Camonte or Rocky Sullivan, and, indeed, remains oddly passive throughout the film. When he does commit murders, it seems to be merely out of an obligation to genre conventions. Even when old friend Jim Wade dramatically demands his execution, Blackie looks on with a detached, amused smirk, doodling idly from the defendant's chair; the expected outburst of emotion never arrives. Instead, the story's central conflict unfolds entirely within the righteous Wade, who must choose between his personal and professional allegiances.<br /><br />'Manhattan Melodrama' has achieved some notoriety for being the film that killed John Dillinger, so to speak. The fugitive bank-robber was gunned down by FBI agents as he emerged from a screening at Chicago's Biograph Theatre on July 22, 1934 (clips from the film were recently featured in Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies (2009)'). These curious circumstances can't help but make one ponder what Dillinger had thought of 'Manhattan Melodrama.' Had he, like Blackie, accepted that his time was coming to an end? Did he welcome death over a lifetime of legal persecution? At the very least, he checked out having experienced a very fine addition to the genre."
9506_0,"Director Ki-duk Kim has done it again. With his beautiful human stories like Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and 3-Iron, he has come up with a very human story of a different sort.<br /><br />One of the most incredible and searing performances I have seen in years by Jae-hyeon Jo, as Han-ki, the Bad Guy, and almost totally wordless. His eyes tell as much about the way he is feeling as any words can. The raw human emotions are amazing. Watching Sun-hwa go from the most innocent girl into the call girl that she becomes makes your heart break but then watching how she begins to feel about the Bad Guy at the end tempers this a little. And that ending, with that traveling den of iniquity makes you feel both sorry for the two and at the same time you feel that these two people have found something that they have been looking for. Once again an Asian film maker ends a film realistically unlike American film makers who always go for the happy ending which would have ruined this story. I do hope that no American film maker decides to remake this film"
9551_0,"Definitely one of my favorites!<br /><br />There are so many creative and innovative ideas and genuine rip-off's of clichés. A real fun to watch. And the stunning art style ... never seen a so detailed and thought-out flick like this one. Even when you watching this film a second time you still might get lost in figuring out all these details. <br /><br />Music was also perfectly used; a 100% match with the art style (something like Rock/Pop ...(?).. well, you'll get it when you see it) Even the slower and moderate background music (simple piano chords), which was used in the middle of the film for quite a long time, was also a consummate choice. <br /><br />The highlight, alongside the art style, of this movie was definitely characters and acting. Every one of them really stand out. Some of the reviews complained about a cliché-kind of presentation of Vinnie Jones. You know, this was intentionally; hinting at the cliché image of Gaikokujin (foreigners) in japan. It is just an amazing performance of the entire cast.<br /><br />If i happen to see this movie presented in an art exhibition, i wouldn't be surprised at all. A real masterpiece, though some might only like it, but not love it, as i do ... well, too bad! ;)"
9597_0,"'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. <br /><br />We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.<br /><br />The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.<br /><br />In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie."
9641_0,"I love this trailer, brings me back to the horror movies of the 70's and early 80's. Films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Children of the Corn, Halloween, films that had a lot of memorable villains were so much fun to watch. I don't like a lot of the new horror movies today like Hostile, The Descent and a lot of the films that Lionsgate puts out. There is so much over the top, icky, gross violence. Watching this preview, I felt like a little kid in the theater again. Even the actors kind of have a nostalgic look to them. Actor David Morwick reminds me of Tommy of Eight is Enough who I had a huge crush on. She, (Vigdis Anholt) reminds me of Glenn Close from Fatal Attraction - fun stuff!"
9687_0,"It's a great movie that shows the changes that happened in the Egyptian Society from the age of the kingdom of Egypt until our age now. He shows this by a building called The Yacoubian Building in which each character in it signifies a character in the Egyptian society. I've one comment on the movie, I don't know why the author included a sex issue in each character as if sex is a main axis in our life. Also the character of Hatem and Abd Rabo I think it's a very rare case in an Islamic society although the actors role was very complicated and hard but they made it with Professionalism. the movie is really so good and the director succeeded in making the movie although its his first movie. enjoy it."
9731_0,"I can't believe that this film is not well known. Get rid of the terrible courtroom framing device, and you have a gangster masterpiece. Coming on the heels of Cagney's better known White Heat, this film takes violence and corruption to a new level. This film starts off with a brutal jail break and never slows down. The cold blooded violence portrayed is quite jaw dropping. Cagney was born to play this role. He is clearly relishing his cold blooded character. The freshness of this film is surprising. You are totally caught off guard. In this sense, it reminds me most of Kiss Me Deadly. For anyone with a passing interest in Cagney, or gangster films, or film-noir, or film violence, watch this film!!!!!!!"
9777_0,"The story was beautiful and provoked deep emotions in many sections, but I felt that much of the talent was aimed at displaying the ordinary communication within the family rather than the love of music or whatever passion the main characters may have had for their chosen lives. I felt cheated in some respects because the music and jobs seemed more window-dressing that life choices. Seeing and hearing Giora Feldman was a surprise and a treat. I wish there had been more about the music or more about the parents and their internal lives."
9821_0,"Video and film allow vast numbers of our citizenry to gather around our intentions while discovering the best or worst of our nation. The possibility of conspiracy on 9/11 is one of those ideas that will continue to incite more and more discussion as time goes by. So much of the 9/11 Truth movement makes total and logical sense. Many of those ideas are certainly in error. But, many are not. As with any disputed historical event, there will be those who deny any truth to a new theory, especially one as foreboding as this one, and those who will believe in conspiracy, no matter the evidence to the contrary. For those who watch ""Loose Change"" with an open mind,"" I suggest going to: www.911scholarsfortruth.org for a detailed and evolving discussion of the alternate possibilities. Videos such as ""Loose Change"" cannot cover the entire subject, nor will it ultimately force the government to conduct a totally unbiased and complete investigation (most of the evidence at ground zero has been destroyed anyway). As usual, only time and sincere scholarly legwork may eventually reveal to us to what really happened that day. For now, however, those of us who find grave gaps in the official investigation must continue to question the intent of a government that desperately needed a ""Pearl Harbor"" level excuse to once again invade the Middle East. Whether this disturbing video contains truth or not, it should be considered amid all the other explanations by anyone who seeks a personal truth amid the mountains of data now available on the internet. To question the official version of this event IS a patriotic act. To allow your government the luxury of unquestioning loyalty is to allow those in power the luxury of corruption. This was not the intent of our founders."
9867_0,"Despite all of the negative reviews I've read, (and there are plenty!) I actually liked this movie. The writing is quite good and even though there requires a certain suspension of disbelief in the plot, the characters remain true to form. Lange and Paltrow I consider to be two of the best actresses around today and they truly carried the film. The film builds a psychodramatic suspense in the characters of Lange and Paltrow that transcends the shortcomings of the plot details."
9911_0,"After looking at all of the comments, regarding it as an awful slasher, I must say in my opinion they are totally wrong.<br /><br />This had all the gore you need, maybe it could of had more, but still has a bloody edge, and the effects wern't all the terrible, even though towards the end when the woman is being grabbed by her hair when she's hanging off the Lighhouse does look a little bit stupid. This actually had above average acting, the characters arn't as wooden as some actors. But it is a B-Movie, and this has proudly made it's way into my top 5 in slashers.<br /><br />I'd give The Lighthouse - 7.5/10<br /><br />God bless British horror...now go watch Cradle Of Fear (Ultimate cheese, awful acting and terrible dialogue = a must for any horror fan like me)"
9957_0,"That Certain Summer is way ahead of it's time for the year 1972.I did not see the movie when it originally aired in 1972. I had not even heard of the movie until I received this movie on VHS tape from a collector.I watched it a couple of nights ago, and I was amazed at the subject matter for the year 1972.First off, the cast was excellent. Hal Holbrook, Hope Lange, Martin Sheen, and Scott Jacoby were just right for their roles.The scenery and setting of San Francisco added to the film's atmosphere.What I like best about the movie is the way that the story ended. The ending did not produce any certain answers for the family involved.The viewer can decide whether the family will make it through the heartache and hurt that all of them are experiencing.This movie was very well done,and is very tender and touching.I recommend this movie very much.I have this movie."
