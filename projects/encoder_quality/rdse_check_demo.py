"""
This script demonstrates how encoder_check.encoderCheck is used.

The example shows that a RandomDistributedScalarEncoder with higher
resolution will more tightly preserve the distance metric of the scalar
input space.

For three scalar values x, y, z, and their encodings Sx, Sy, and Sz, if
the overlap of Sx and Sy is greater than the overlap of Sx and Sz, we would
hope that the distance between x and y is less than the distance between x and
z. This is the logic that the encoderCheck employs. If it finds values that
violate this property, it reports it with a warning.
