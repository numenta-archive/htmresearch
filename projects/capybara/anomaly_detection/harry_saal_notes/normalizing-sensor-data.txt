Aligning all sensor values to the direction of gravity using accelerometer data

If the sensor is placed on the ankle as directed, e.g. "arrow pointing down", 
then the force of gravity should be entirely in the -y direction. (16 units == 1G) In practice, the sensor is not stricly vertical. 
By analyzing the data, assuming it begins with the leg at rest, we can detect the degree of rotation in the x and z axes. 
From the apparent measurements, we can correct all the sensor data so that y is strictly downwards and x and z are perpendicular. 
Using only the gravity vector we cannot correct for any rotation about the y axis. 
In the future, the magnetometer could support such a correction.)

This is a description of an alogrithm to accomplish this normalization of the data.

Compute the magnitude of the acceleration force for the first series of data points, say 25 of them. (Compute G2=x^2+y^2+z^2.)
The values should lie close to 16*16=256. I suggest computing this value, and searching for the last i such that G2(i) is within 5% of 256. 
If i is less than some threshhold (say 10) then reject the data set as unstable. 
Otherwise compute the average of the accelerometer x, y and z for the i initial data points. Let these averages be referred to as X, Y and Z.

Compute PHI=ATAN(-X/Y)
Compute OM=ATAN(Z/(X*SIN(PHI)+Y*COS(PHI)))  [OM is short for OMEGA]

We can now apply a rotation matrix to the x y and z values for all three sensors, not only acceleration, using the following transformations:

X1=X*COS(PHI)+Y*SIN(PHI)
Y1=-X*SIN(PHI)*COS(OM)+Y*COS(PHI)*COS(OM)+Z*SIN(OM)
Z1=-X*SIN(PHI)*SIN(OM)-Y*COS(PHI)*SIN(OM)+Z*COS(OM)

Attached is a screen shot of some uncorrected accelerometer data (left) and the correct data (right).

This data normalization should make the concatenation of data from different individuals and different runs more amenable to modeling.
